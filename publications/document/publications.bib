	abstract = {In the broader polymer field, the term ‘crystallinity’ is often used rather loosely. However, increasingly, it becomes critical to clearly distinguish between degree of crystallinity, which provides the fractional amount of crystalline phase in a polymer, and the crystalline quality, which describes the perfection of the crystalline moieties that may form in a polymer. The reason is that these different structural features dictate important properties of plastic materials, including the mechanical properties of commodity polymers and the behavior of macromolecular ferroelectrics; they also determine which photophysical processes occur in semiconducting polymers. Hence, rigor needs to be applied when establishing structure/processing/property interrelations; and it should become a general practice that specific functions are clearly attributed to the degree of crystallinity, the crystalline quality or a combination of the two. In this perspective, in memoriam of Professor Dick Jones, a long-time member of IUPAC's Polymer Division, we discuss the challenges of identifying—and distinguishing between—these important structural characteristics when using commonly applied measuring techniques and/or theoretical approaches. This task is often elaborate, as small changes in the chemical nature of the polymer and/or processing conditions selected can have drastic effects on both the crystalline quality and the degree of crystallinity, an issue that combined with the general ambiguity of data obtained with methodologies used to characterize polymer structures, theoretically or experimentally based. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Electrocaloric refrigeration is one of the most promising environmentally-friendly technologies to replace current cooling platforms—if a notable electrocaloric effect (ECE) is realized around room temperature where the highest need is. Here, a straight-forward, one-pot chemical modification of P(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CTFE) is reported through the controlled introduction of small fractions of double bonds within the backbone that, very uniquely, decreases the lamellar crystalline thickness while, simultaneously, enlarging the crystalline coherence along the a-b plane. This increases the polarizability and polarization without affecting the degree of crystallinity or amending the crystal unit cell—undesirable effects observed with other approaches. Specifically, the permittivity increases by >35%, from 52 to 71 at 1 kHz, and ECE improves by >60% at moderate electric fields. At 40 °C, an adiabatic temperature change >2 K is realized at 60 MV m−1 (>5.5 K at 192 MV m−1), compared to ≈1.3 K for pristine P(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CTFE), highlighting the promise of a simple, versatile approach that allows direct film deposition without requiring any post-treatment such as mechanical stretching or high-temperature annealing for achieving the desired performance. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {Frenkel excitons are unequivocally responsible for the optical properties of organic semiconductors and are predicted to form bound exciton pairs (biexcitons). These are key intermediates, ubiquitous in many photophysical processes such as the exciton bimolecular annihilation dynamics in such systems. Because of their spectral ambiguity, there has been, to date, only scant direct evidence of bound biexcitons. By using nonlinear coherent spectroscopy, we identify here bound biexcitons in a model polymeric semiconductor. We find, unexpectedly, that excitons with interchain vibronic dispersion reveal intrachain biexciton correlations and vice versa. Moreover, using a Frenkel exciton model, we relate the biexciton binding energy to molecular parameters quantified by quantum chemistry, including the magnitude and sign of the exciton-exciton interaction the intersite hopping energies. Therefore, our work promises general insights into the many-body electronic structure in polymeric semiconductors and beyond, e.g., other excitonic systems such as organic semiconductor crystals, molecular aggregates, photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, or DNA.

	abstract = {The relation of phase morphology and solid-state microstructure with organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance has intensely been investigated over the last twenty years. While it has been established that a combination of donor:acceptor intermixing and presence of relatively phase-pure donor and acceptor domains is needed to get an optimum compromise between charge generation and charge transport/charge extraction, a quantitative picture of how much intermixing is needed is still lacking. This is mainly due to the difficulty in quantitatively analyzing the intermixed phase, which generally is amorphous. Here, fast scanning calorimetry, which allows measurement of device-relevant thin films (<200 nm thickness), is exploited to deduce the precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk-heterojunction structures. The power of fast scanning calorimetry is illustrated by considering two polymer:fullerene model systems. Somewhat surprisingly, it is found that a relatively small fraction (<15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads to efficient charge generation. In contrast, charge transport can only be sustained in blends with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: ≈58 wt%). This example shows that fast scanning calorimetry is an important tool for establishing a complete compositional characterization of organic bulk heterojunctions. Hence, it will be critical in advancing quantitative morphology–function models that allow for the rational design of these devices, and in delivering insights in, for example, solar cell degradation mechanisms via phase separation, especially for more complex high-performing systems such as nonfullerene acceptor:polymer bulk heterojunctions. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

Two new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-terthiophene-based conjugated polymers PDPP3T-1 and PDPP3T-2, with both hydrophilic triethylene glycol (TEG) and hydrophobic alkyl chains, are reported. It is demonstrated that the incorporation of TEG chains has a significant effect on the interchain packing and thin-film morphology with noticeable effect on charge transport. Polymer chains of PDPP3T-1 in which TEG chains are uniformly distributed can self-assemble spontaneously into a more ordered thin film. As a result, the thin film of PDPP3T-1 exhibits high saturated hole mobility up to 2.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 without any post-treatment. This is superior to those of PDPP3T with just alkyl chains and PDPP3T-2. Moreover, the respective field effect transistors made of PDPP3T-1 can be utilized for sensing ethanol vapor with high sensitivity (down to 100 ppb) and good selectivity. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {One grand challenge for printed organic electronics is the development of a knowledge platform that describes how polymer semiconductors assemble from solution, which requires a unified picture of the complex interplay of polymer solubility, mass transport, nucleation and, e.g., vitrification. One crucial aspect, thereby, is aggregate formation, i.e., the development of electronic coupling between adjacent chain segments. Here, it is shown that the critical aggregation temperatures in solution (no solvent evaporation allowed) and during film formation (solvent evaporation occurring) are excellent pointers to i) establish reliable criteria for polymer assembly into desired aggregates, and ii) advance mechanistic understanding of the overall polymer assembly. Indeed, important insights are provided on why aggregation occurs via a 1- or 2-step process depending on polymer solubility, deposition temperature and solvent evaporation rate; and the selection of deposition temperatures for specific scenarios (e.g., good vs bad solvent) is demystified. Collectively, it is demonstrated that relatively straightforward, concurrent in situ time-resolved absorbance and photoluminescence spectroscopies to monitor aggregate formation lead to highly useful and broadly applicable criteria for processing functional plastics. In turn, improved control over their properties and device performance can be obtained toward manufacturing sensors, energy-harvesting devices and, e.g., bioelectronics systems at high yield. © 2024 The Authors.

Comparing an open-cage ketolactam fullerene with the prototypical[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester in blends with poly[2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT), we demonstrate that experimentally established, non-equilibrium temperature/composition phase diagrams can be useful beyond rationalization of optimum blend composition for OPV device performance. Indeed, they can be exploited as tools for rapid, qualitative structure-property mapping, providing insights into why apparent similar donor:acceptor blends display different optoelectronic processes resulting from changes in the phase-morphology formation induced by the different chemistries of the fullerenes. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

When the fused-ring benzofuran is combined to EBI (EBI-BF), the molecules displayed a perfectly planar conformation and afforded the best charge transport properties among these EBI compounds with a hole mobility of up to 0.02 cm2 V-1 s-1. All EBI-based small molecules were used as donor material along with a PC61BM acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The best performing photovoltaic devices are based on the EBI derivative using the bithiophene end-capping moiety (EBI-2T) with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.92%, owing to the broad absorption spectra of EBI-2T and the appropriate morphology of the BHJ.

Two different MLC structures were prepared with nine layers each and layer thicknesses of 86 μm and 39 μm. The influence of the device design on its properties has been characterized by microstructural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and direct electrocaloric measurement. For direct characterization two different methods, ie temperature reading (thermistor and thermocouple) and heat flow measurement (differential scanning calorimetry), were used. A comparison of results revealed a highly satisfactory agreement between the different methods. This study confirms that MLCs are promising candidates for implementation into energy-efficient electrocaloric cooling systems providing large refrigerant volume and high electrocaloric effect. Due to their micron-sized active layers, they allow for the application of high electric fields under low operation voltages. We measured a maximum electrocaloric temperature change of ΔT=2.67 K under application/withdrawal of an electric field of ΔE=16 kV mm−1, which corresponds to operation voltages below 1.5 kV. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society},

	abstract = {Aggregates – that is short-ranged ordered moieties in the solid-state of π-conjugated polymers – play an important role in the photophysics and performance of various optoelectronic devices. We have previously shown that many polymers change from a disordered to a more ordered conformation when cooling a solution below a characteristic critical temperature Tc. Using in situ time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on the prototypical semiconducting polymers P3HT, PFO, PCPDTBT, and PCE11 (PffBT4T-2OD), we show that spin-coating at a temperature below Tc can enhance the formation of aggregates with strong intra-chain coupling. An analysis of their time-resolved spectra indicates that the formation of nuclei in the initial stages of film formation for substrates held below Tc seems responsible for this. We observe that the growth rate of the aggregates is thermally activated with an energy of 310 meV, which is much more than that of the solvent viscosity (100 meV). From this we conclude that the rate controlling step is the planarization of a chain that is associated with its attachment to a nucleation center. The success of our approach for the rather dynamic deposition method of spin-coating holds promise for other solution-based deposition methods. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

As a consequence, a detailed understanding of how to manipulate the molecular ordering, e.g., through knowledge of relevant phase transitions, solidification processes, relevant solidification mechanisms, kinetic factors, etc., is required to induce the desired optoelectronic response. In this chapter, we will discuss relevant structural features of single and multicomponent systems, provide a case study of the multifaceted structure that polymer: fullerene systems can adopt and highlight relevant solidification mechanisms such as nucleation and growth, liquid-liquid phase separation and spinodal decomposition. In addition, co-crystal formation, solid solutions and eutectic systems are treated and their relevance within the optoelectronics area emphasized. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

	abstract = {VDF-based polymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers, are well-known ferroelectrics of interest for numerous applications, from energy storage to electrocaloric refrigeration. However, their often complex thermal phase behavior that typically leads to a low phase-stability can drastically affect the long-term dielectric properties of this materials family. Here, we demonstrate on the example of the terpolymer P(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CFE) (molar ratio: 64/29/7) that by limiting mass transport/segmental chain motion both during solidification and in the solid state, a drastically smaller "burn-in" in relative permittivity, ϵr, is observed. Indeed, ϵrdecreases little over time and saturates rapidly at 96-97% of its initial value. Mass transport thereby is limited by using highly entangled systems via the selection of a suitable polymer solution concentration and molecular weight. In addition, rapid solvent extraction assists in reducing unwanted relaxation processes. Accordingly, increased control of the phase stability of P(VDF-ter-TrFE-ter-CFE) is gained. Moreover, pathways are opened to reliably identify processing routes for any given VDF-based polymer, with critical information being obtained from thermal analysis and rheometry data only, enabling rapid feedback to material design, including the prediction of required molecular weights without the need for complex characterization methodologies. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {The molecular-level arrangement of the donor and acceptor (i.e. the local morphology) in organic solar cells governs charge separation and charge transport via its effect on the mobility of charges. However, the nanometre-scale mobility in such systems, which can be measured using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, has been little investigated at relevant low excitation densities, due to extremely weak signals. Here, we study the mobility over short distances and at ultrashort times using time-resolved optical-pump-THz-probe (OPTP) spectroscopy on pBTTT:PCBM blends. This complements our previous results obtained with transient absorption (TA) and electro-modulated differential absorption (EDA) techniques. In the pBTTT:PCBM system, the co-existence of fullerene-/polymer-rich (‘neat') and co-crystalline (‘intermixed') regions can be controlled through choice of composition (weight ratio of the two components, use of processing additive). We demonstrate high short-range mobilities that help charges separate, and we show how this mobility of photogenerated charges develops in time, in particular as the charges move between different phase regions of the blend. By reducing the pump fluence below the threshold for nonlinear recombination mechanisms, we access these properties at solar cell operating conditions. Overall, we explain the necessity of different local phases through their influence on charge lifetime and mobility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

This variation has previously been shown to modify the polymer microstructure, with low molecular weights forming a one-phase, paraffinic-like structure comprised of chain-extended crystallites, and higher molecular weights forming a semicrystalline structure with crystalline domains being embedded in an amorphous matrix. Using Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage (CELIV), we show here that the carrier mobility in P3HT devices peaks for materials of Mw = 48 kDa, and that the recombination rate decreases monotonically with increasing molecular weight. This trend is likely due to the development of a semicrystalline, two-phase structure with increasing Mw, which allows for the spatial separation of holes and electrons into the amorphous and crystalline regions, respectively. This separation leads to decreased recombination. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym. Phys. 2018, 56, 31–35. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The exploitation of ubiquitous temperature gradients, as the source of energy, can become a practical solution, since the recent discovery of the outstanding thermoelectric properties of a conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Unfortunately the use of PEDOT:PSS is currently constrained by its brittleness and limited processability. Herein, PEDOT:PSS is blended with a commercial elastomeric polyurethane (Lycra), to obtain tough and processable self-standing films. A remarkable strain-at-break of ≈700% is achieved for blends with 90 wt% Lycra, after ethylene glycol treatment, without affecting the Seebeck voltage. For the first time the viability of these novel blends as stretchable self-powered sensors is demonstrated. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

	abstract = {The optoelectronic landscape of conjugated polymers is intimately related to their molecular arrangement and packing, with minute changes in local order, such as chain conformation and torsional backbone order/disorder, frequently having a substantial effect on macroscopic properties. While many of these local features can be manipulated via chemical design, the synthesis of a series of compounds is often required to elucidate correlations between chemical structure and macromolecular ordering. Here, we show that blending semiconducting polymers with insulating commodity plastics enables controlled manipulation of the semiconductor backbone planarity. The key is to create a polarity difference between the semiconductor backbone and its side chains, while matching the polarity of the side chains and the additive. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach through judicious comparison of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with two of its more polar derivatives, namely the diblock copolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-b-PEO) and the graft polymer poly[3-but(ethylene oxide)thiophene] (P3BEOT), as well as their blends with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Proximity between polar side chains and a similarly polar additive reduces steric hindrance between individual chain segments by essentially "expelling" the side chains away from the semiconducting backbones. This process, shown to be facilitated via exposure to polar environments such as humid air/water vapor, facilitates backbone realignment toward specific chain arrangements and, in particular, planar backbone configurations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Indacenodithiophene (IDT) copolymers are a class of conjugated polymers that have limited long-range order and high hole mobilities, which makes them promising candidates for use in deformable electronic devices. Key to their high hole mobilities is the coplanar monomer repeat units within the backbone. Poly(indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole) (PIDTC16-BT) and poly(indacenodithiophene-Thiapyrollodione) (PIDTC16-TPDC1) are two IDT copolymers with planar backbones, but they are brittle at low molecular weight and have unsuitably high elastic moduli. Substitution of the hexadecane (C16) side chains of the IDT monomer with isocane (C20) side chains was performed to generate a new BT-containing IDT copolymer: PIDTC20-BT. Substitution of the methyl (C1) side chain on the TPD monomer for an octyl (C8) and 6-ethylundecane (C13B) afford two new TPD-containing IDT copolymers named PIDTC16-TPDC8and PIDTC16-TPDC13B, respectively. Both PIDTC16-TPDC8and PIDTC16-TPDC13Bare relatively well deformable, have a low yield strain, and display significantly reduced elastic moduli. These mechanical properties manifest themselves because the lengthened side chains extending from the TPD-monomer inhibit precise intermolecular ordering. In PIDTC16-BT, PIDTC20-BT and PIDTC16-TPDC1side chain ordering can occur because the side chains are only present on the IDT subunit, but this results in brittle thin films. In contrast, PIDTC16-TPDC8and PIDTC16-TPDC13Bhave disordered side chains, which seems to lead to low hole mobilities. These results suggest that disrupting the interdigitation in IDT copolymers through comonomer side chain extension leads to more ductile thin films with lower elastic moduli, but decreased hole mobility because of altered local order in the respective thin films. Our work, thus, highlights the trade-off between molecular packing structure for deformable electronic materials and provides guidance for designing new conjugated polymers for stretchable electronics. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

However, rationalization of the limiting factors to access such regimes is still lacking. An improved understanding in this area is critical for development of new materials, establishing processing guidelines, and broadening of the range of applications. Here we show that precise processing of a diketopyrrolopyrrole-tetrafluorobenzene-based electron transporting copolymer results in single crystal-like and voltage-independent mobility with vanishing activation energy above 280 K. Key factors are uniaxial chain alignment and thermal annealing at temperatures within the melting endotherm of films. Experimental and computational evidences converge toward a picture of electrons being delocalized within crystalline domains of increased size. Residual energy barriers introduced by disordered regions are bypassed in the direction of molecular alignment by a more efficient interconnection of the ordered domains following the annealing process. © 2019, The Author(s).},

According to the conceptual definition of the glass transition temperature (Tg), that is, the temperature marking the crossover from the melt in metastable equilibrium to the nonequilibrium glass, an enthalpy relaxation should be observed by calorimetry when the glass is aged below Tg. Thus, we are able to identify the enthalpy relaxations of mobile and rigid amorphous fractions (MAF and RAF, respectively) of P3HT and to determine their respective Tg.

These rely on the destructive/constructive interference between incident, reflected, and transmitted radiation. While known for over a century and having been extremely well investigated, the emergence of printable and large-area electronics brings a new emphasis: the development of materials capable of transferring well-established ideas to a solution-based production. Here, demonstrated is the solution-fabrication of ARCs and DBRs utilizing alternating layers of commodity plastics and recently developed organic/inorganic hybrid materials comprised of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAl), cross-linked with titanium oxide hydrates. Dip-coated ARCs exhibit an 88% reduction in reflectance across the visible compared to uncoated glass, and fully solution-coated DBRs provide a reflection of >99% across a 100 nm spectral band in the visible region. Detailed comparisons with transfermatrix methods (TMM) highlight their excellent optical quality including extremely low optical losses. Beneficially, when exposed to elevated temperatures, the hybrid material can display a notable, reproducible, and irreversible change in refractive index and film thickness while maintaining excellent optical performance allowing postdeposition tuning, e.g., for thermo-responsive applications, including security features and product-storage environment monitoring. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The low- and high-spin states can be reversibly selected through application of external stimulus-often simply a variation in temperature. Since the particular spin-state embodies optical, electronic and structural characteristics, the spin switching can be readily detected or probed using a variety of techniques. In this regard, SCO phenomena show great promise for a range of devices. The key to this uptake is the preparation of high-quality, thin-films capable of retaining SCO properties, and solution-based materials, in particular, provide further opportunities for integration or blending with other functional materials. The present work examines SCO behaviour from two iron(ii)-triazole polymers, with short and long side chains, prepared and investigated in a variety of formats-from bulk powders to thick and thin films. Magnetic, optical and electronic techniques all verify the SCO behaviour is faithfully maintained for all formats. The two materials serve to highlight the impact on key properties arising from the different density of Fe atoms. The results, all from solution-based materials, are extremely promising and clearly emphasise the growing capabilities and processing advances associated with SCO compounds. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We provide, from a materials physics perspective, a concise and accessible overview on the relation between fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic principles relevant to (solution) processing, active layer morphology and stability of organic electronic devices based on blends by means of illustrative examples from organic photovoltaics. We aim to address a wide audience, including synthetic chemists, materials scientists, device engineers and beyond. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Organic electronics technologies have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades and have become promising alternatives to conventional, inorganic platforms for specific applications. To fully exploit the touted potential of plastic electronics, however, other prerequisites than only electronic functions need to be fulfiled, including good mechanical stability, ease of processing and high device reliability. A possible method to overcome these issues is the employment of insulating:semiconducting polymer blends, which have been demonstrated to display favourable rheological and mechanical properties, generally provided by the insulating component, without negatively affecting the optoelectronic performance of the semiconductor. Here, we demonstrate that binary blends comprising the semicrystalline high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in combination with hole- and electron-transporting organic semiconductors allow fabrication of p-type and n-type thin-film transistors of notably improved device stability and, in some scenarios, improved device performance. We observe, for example, considerably lower subthreshold slopes and drastically reduced bias-stress effects in devices fabricated with a hole-transporting diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer derivative when blended with HDPE and significantly enhanced charge-carrier mobilities and shelf life in case of transistors made with blends between HDPE and the electron-transporting poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)}, i.e. P(NDI2OD-T2), also known as N2200, compared to the neat material, highlighting the broad, versatile benefits blending semiconducting species with a semicrystalline commodity polymer can have.

Indeed, highly relevant insights can be gained that are useful, e.g., for further materials-discovery activities and the establishment of reliable processing protocols, in particular if combined with X-ray diffraction techniques, spectroscopic tools, and scanning electron microscopy enabled by vapor-phase infiltration staining.

	abstract = {Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near-intrinsic properties using channel-die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge-on orientation is obtained for poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm-thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge-transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the π-stacking. Indeed, charge-carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 are measured along the π-stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge-carrier densities (drop-cast films display mobilities of maximum ≈10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well-defined photoluminescence line-shape characteristic of an H-aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ-aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n-type devices, such as poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (≈1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel-die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {Since doped polymers require a charge-neutralizing counter-ion to maintain charge neutrality, tailored and high degrees of doping in organic semiconductors requires an understanding of the coupling between ionic and electronic carrier motion. A method of counter-ion exchange is utilized using the polymeric semiconductor poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] -C14 to deconvolute the effects of ionic/polaronic interactions with the electrical properties of doped semiconducting polymers. In particular, exchanging the counter-ions of the dopant nitrosonium hexafluorophosphate enables investigation into the role of counter-ion size from 5.2 to 8.2 Å in diameter. The orientational order of the polymeric crystallites is not affected with this exchange process while effectively modifying the counter-ion distance to the charge carrier. Doped films have electrical conductivities of 320 S cm−1 and are not sensitive to an increased ion-polaron distance. It is posited that other factors dominate the electrical properties at a device scale, such as the morphology and presence of domain boundaries. Interestingly, the temperature stability of the doped film can be drastically improved with the use of counter-ions containing less labile bonds. This platform serves as a unique way to retain the morphology of polymeric thin films while studying charge interactions at the local scale. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {In view of a rapid development and increase in efficiency of organic solar cells, reaching their long-term operational stability represents now one of the main challenges to be addressed on the way toward commercialization of this photovoltaic technology. However, intrinsic degradation pathways occurring in organic solar cells under realistic operational conditions remain poorly understood. The light-induced dimerization of the fullerene-based acceptor materials discovered recently is considered to be one of the main causes for burn-in degradation of organic solar cells. In this work, it is shown that not only the fullerene derivatives but also different types of conjugated polymers and small molecules undergo similar light-induced crosslinking regardless of their chemical composition and structure. In the case of conjugated polymers, crosslinking of macromolecules leads to a rapid increase in their molecular weight and consequent loss of solubility, which can be revealed in a straightforward way by gel permeation chromatography analysis via a reduction/loss of signal and/or smaller retention times. Results of this work, thus, shift the paradigm of research in the field toward designing a new generation of organic absorbers with enhanced intrinsic photochemical stability in order to reach practically useful operation lifetimes required for successful commercialization of organic photovoltaics. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Herein, we elucidate the impact of tubular confinement on the structure and relaxation behavior of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and how these affect the para-/ferroelectric behavior of this polymer. We use PVDF nanotubes that were solidified in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. Dielectric spectroscopy measurements evidence a bimodal relaxation process for PVDF nanotubes: besides the bulk-like α-relaxation, we detect a notably slower relaxation that is associated with the PVDF regions of restricted dynamics at the interface with the AAO pore. Strikingly, both the bulk-like and the interfacial relaxation tend to become temperature independent as the temperature increases, a behavior that has been observed before in inorganic relaxor ferroelectrics. In line with this, we observe that the real part of the dielectric permittivity of the PVDF nanotubes exhibits a broad maximum when plotted against the temperature, which is, again, a typical feature of relaxor ferroelectrics. As such, we propose that, in nanotubular PVDF, ferroelectric-like nanodomains are formed in the amorphous phase regions adjacent to the AAO interface. These ferroelectric nanodomains may result from an anisotropic chain conformation and a preferred orientation of local dipoles due to selective H-bond formation between the PVDF macromolecues and the AAO walls. Such relaxor-ferroelectric-like behavior has not been observed for nonirradiated PVDF homopolymer; our findings thus may enable in the future alternative applications for this bulk commodity plastic, e.g., for the production of electrocaloric devices for solid-state refrigeration which benefit from a relaxor-ferroelectric-like response. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Here, this concept is extended to hybrid halide perovskite-based materials. In situ time-resolved grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements performed during spin coating reveal that organic gelators beneficially influence the nucleation and growth of the perovskite precursor phase. This can be exploited for the fabrication of planar n-i-p heterojunction devices with MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) that display a performance that not only is enhanced by ≈25% compared to solar cells where the active layer is produced without the use of a gelator but that also features a higher stability to moisture and a reduced hysteresis. Most importantly, the presented approach is straightforward and simple, and it provides a general method to render the film formation of hybrid perovskites more reliable and robust, analogous to the control that is afforded by these additives in the processing of commodity “plastics.”. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {We investigate the molecular order and thin film morphology of the conjugated polymer polytellurophene, in order to understand how the tellurium atom and the choice of side-chain influence the conjugated polymer's backbone planarity and performance in organic transistors. We find that poly(3hexyltellurophene) (P3HTe) continues the trend from polythiophene (P3HT) to polyselenophene (P3HS): substitution with Tellurium leads to a more planar backbone, evident from the shifts of the C=C vibrational peak to lower wavenumbers (∼1389 cm-1) and a smaller optical band gap (∼1.4 eV). Resonant Raman spectroscopy revealed that molecular order was highly dependent on the structure of the P3ATe alkyl side-chain: a longer chains introduces kinetic hindrance, reducing the fraction of ordered phase obtained at room temperature, while a branched side-chain introduces steric hindrance, with intrinsic disorder present even when deposited at higher temperatures. When blended with the insulator HDPE, all three polymers exhibit little additional disorder and instead form phase-separated networks of high molecular order that are beneficial to percolated charge transport in transistors. We find that molecular order, as measured by Raman, correlates well with reported transistor mobilities and provides a greater understanding of the structure-property relationships that determine the performance of these novel organometallic polymers in electronic devices.

	abstract = {Organic semiconducting small molecules have attracted increasing interest over the last decades because of their versatile, tunable optoelectronic properties and, e.g., the ease they can be purified compared to polymeric systems. Hence, over the past few decades, a large number of small molecules, such as acenes and thiophenes, have been explored for use in semiconducting devices such as thin-film transistors. However, many of these materials can adopt various molecular arrangements, producing polymorphic structures. As a result, the same material can display vastly different optoelectronic properties. This can, in many cases, lead to a large spread of device performances. Hence, it is critical to establish knowledge- and characterization libraries towards relevant structure/processing/performance interrelations to further advance this interesting class of materials and to open new application platforms. Here, we discuss processing strategies and methodologies that allow the control and assessment of polymorph formation in semiconducting small molecules using 5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (TES ADT) as a model material system. We revise how a window into the complex phase behavior of semiconducting small molecules can be obtained, how specific polymorphs can be induced, and how post-deposition treatments can be exploited. Moreover, we illustrate pathways towards patterned structures as needed to fully exploit the touted potential of this interesting class of semiconductors.  © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

These were grown by drop-casting PCBM solutions onto the spectrosil substrates and by removing the residual solvent in a vacuum. A home-built atomic force microscope featuring a plane mirror differential optical interferometer, fiber-fed from a frequency-stabilized laser (emitting at 632.8 nm), was used to measure the crystals' height. The optical interferometer together with the stabilized laser provides traceability (via the laser wavelength) of the vertical measurements made with the atomic force microscope. We find that the crystals can conform to the surface topography, thanks to their height being significantly smaller compared to their lateral dimensions (namely, heights between about 50 nm and 140 nm, for the crystals analysed, vs. several tens of microns lateral dimensions). The vast majority of the crystals are flat, but an isolated, non-flat crystal provides insights into the growth mechanism and allows identification of "molecular terraces" whose height corresponds to one of the lattice constants of the single PCBM crystal (1.4 nm) as measured with X-ray diffraction. © 2016 Crown.},

We used high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a sacrificial additive for the processing of NiOx nanoparticle (NP) dispersions which is removed from the film by oxygen plasma prior to the active layer deposition. Through comprehensive characterization by optical, electrical and scanning probe techniques we show that an optimal NiOx:PEO ratio allows to disperse the NPs, hindering their aggregation and maximizing device performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach by inkjet printing the NiOx:PEO blends to produce hole transport layers (HTLs) for P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells with comparable efficiencies to devices produced with high-temperature precursor-based approaches. The utilization of P3HT:PCBM as active layer material is meant to offer an optimum standard for the introduction of the presented HTL processing approach and its applicability to a wider range of hybrid systems and multilayer optoelectronic devices. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Quantum chemical calculations show that p(IDT-BPD) has a barrier to torsion that is significantly lower than that of p(IDT-BT) and is thus more likely to have reduced conjugation lengths. We utilize absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy to characterize energetic disorder and show that p(IDT-BPD) has higher energetic disorder. Charge modulation spectroscopy (CMS) and model calculations are used to show that charge carriers are substantially delocalized in p(IDT-BT) and occupy near-uniform energetic environments. We find that mobility activated hopping barriers are similar in these two materials. Electronic structure calculations show that both intrachain and interchain couplings of monomer units are poor enough in p(IDT-BPD) that charge carriers collapse to single IDT units and transport via a through-space tunneling mechanism. This work highlights the remarkable charge transport properties of p(IDT-BT) by showing that high mobilities are achievable on device-relevant length scales with only 1D carrier delocalization. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Organic solar cells incorporating non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have reached remarkable power conversion efficiencies of over 18%. Unlike fullerene derivatives, NFAs tend to crystallize from solutions, resulting in bulk heterojunctions that include a crystalline acceptor phase. This must be considered in any morphology-function models. Here, it is confirmed that high-performing solution-processed indacenodithienothiophene-based NFAs, i.e., ITIC and its derivatives ITIC-M, ITIC-2F, and ITIC-Th, exhibit at least two crystalline forms. In addition to highly ordered polymorphs that form at high temperatures, NFAs arrange into a low-temperature metastable phase that is readily promoted via solution processing and leads to the highest device efficiencies. Intriguingly, the low-temperature forms seem to feature a continuous network that favors charge transport despite of a poorly order along the π–π stacking direction. As the optical absorption of the structurally more disordered low-temperature phase can surpass that of the more ordered polymorphs while displaying comparable—or even higher—charge transport properties, it is argued that such a packing structure is an important feature for reaching highest device efficiencies, thus, providing guidelines for future materials design and crystal engineering activities. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Poly(indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole) has received significant interest because of its exceptional hole mobility despite its near-amorphous thin-film morphology and brittleness at low Mn. In comparison, poly(indacenodithiophene-benzopyrollodione) (PIDTBPD) has a lower hole mobility but is exceptionally ductile at similar Mn. Herein, we synthesize random indacenodithiophene (IDT) copolymers with varying amounts of incorporated benzothiadiazole and benzopyrollodione (BPD), which introduces varied degrees of backbone twist to each respective polymer system. This allows us to elucidate how the BPD monomer introduction leads to conformational and morphological changes that influence the crack onset strain (CoS) and hole mobility of these near-amorphous IDT copolymers and the rates by which each material property responds to sequentially larger BPD incorporation. Results of density functional theory calculations suggest that BPD introduction does not lead to significant differences in backbone linearity between the studied polymers, and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering demonstrates that the degree of crystallinity within thin films is not significantly altered. It does, however, lead to a more varied circular distribution of the hexadecyl side chains around the polymer backbone. With increasing BPD incorporation, a crossover point between CoS and hole mobility emerges. At this crossover point, a random copolymer with 30% BPD introduction displays increased CoS and an average hole mobility value equal to that of the PIDTBPD system, suggesting that hole mobility is more sensitive to torsion along the polymer backbone, while the response of the CoS is relatively delayed. The data also suggest that the increase in CoS with increasing BPD content does not arise because of differences in rigidity but because the more circular distribution of the side chains makes polymer chains with sufficient BPD content better able to flow.

	abstract = {Rapid developments in the field of organic solar cells have been driven by this technology's potentially advantageous traits: the environmentally friendly, low-cost generation of energy with the possibility of large area manufacturing of flexible, lightweight, semi-transparent devices, with predicted low energy payback times. Major step changes leading to vastly improved devices with ever-increasing performance have been achieved through new insights into materials design and an improved understanding of the often complex microstructure and phase morphology of organic solar cell systems. This chapter summarises the advances in synthesis, concentrating on the relevant structure/property relations and how the chemical structure affects processing and the microstructure. This is followed by a detailed discussion of classical materials science approaches that assist in gaining insights into complex materials systems, such as organic solar cell blends from the molecular to the micrometre scale, with a focus on polymer-based systems and how to apply this knowledge to future larger area processing of organic photovoltaic architectures. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.},

	abstract = {The ever increasing library of materials systems developed for organic solar-cells, including highly promising non-fullerene acceptors and new, high-efficiency donor polymers, demands the development of methodologies that i) allow fast screening of a large number of donor:acceptor combinations prior to device fabrication and ii) permit rapid elucidation of how processing affects the final morphology/microstructure of the device active layers. Efficient, fast screening will ensure that important materials combinations are not missed; it will accelerate the technological development of this alternative solar-cell platform toward larger-area production; and it will permit understanding of the structural changes that may occur in the active layer over time. Using the relatively high-efficiency poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PCE11):phenyl-C61-butyric acid-methyl-ester acceptor (PCBM) blend systems, it is demonstrated that by means of straight-forward thermal analysis, vapor-phase-infiltration imaging, and transient-absorption spectroscopy, various blend compositions and processing methodologies can be rapidly screened, information on promising combinations can be obtained, reliability issues with respect to reproducibility of thin-film formation can be identified, and insights into how processing aids, such as nucleating agents, affect structure formation, can be gained. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The relationship between charge transport and surface morphology is investigated by utilizing rubrene single crystals of varying thicknesses. In the case of pristine crystals, the surface conductivities decrease exponentially as the crystal thickness increases until ∼4 μm, beyond which the surface conductivity saturates. Investigation of the surface morphology using optical and atomic force microscopy reveals that thicker crystals have a higher number of molecular steps, increasing the overall surface roughness compared with thin crystals. The density of molecular steps as a surface trap is further quantified with the subthreshold slope of rubrene air-gap transistors. This thickness-dependent surface conductivity is rationalized by a shift from in-plane to out-of-plane transport governed by surface roughness. The surface transport is disrupted by roughening of the crystal surface and becomes limited by the slower vertical crystallographic axis on molecular step edges. Separately, we investigate surface-doping of rubrene crystals by using fluoroalkyltrichrolosilane and observe a different mechanism for charge transport which is independent of surface roughness. This work demonstrates that the correlation between crystal thickness, surface morphology, and charge transport must be taken into account when measuring organic single crystals. Considering the fact that these molecular steps are universally observed on organic/inorganic and single/polycrystals, we believe that our findings can be widely applied to improve charge transport understanding. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

The aim of this study was to investigate effect of the two-dimensional spatial confinement on the internal structure of the semiconducting polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO). PFO melts were confined inside the cylindrical nanopores of anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates and crystallized via two crystallization strategies, namely, in the presence or in the absence of a surface bulk reservoir located at the template surface. We show that highly textured semiconducting nanowires with tuneable crystal orientation can be thus produced. The results presented here demonstrate the simple fabrication and crystal engineering of ordered arrays of PFO nanowires; a system with potential applications in devices where anisotropic optical properties are required, such as polarized electroluminescence, waveguiding, optical switching and lasing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Planar microcavities with strong light–matter coupling, monolithically processed fully from solution, consisting of two polymer-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) comprising alternating layers of a high-refractive-index titanium oxide hydrate/poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid material and a low-refractive-index fluorinated polymer are presented. The DBRs enclose a perylene diimide derivative (b-PDI-1) film positioned at the antinode of the optical mode. Strong light–matter coupling is achieved in these structures at the target excitation of the b-PDI-1. Indeed, the energy-dispersion relation (energy vs in-plane wavevector or output angle) in reflectance and the group delay of transmitted light in the microcavities show a clear anti-crossing—an energy gap between two distinct exciton-polariton dispersion branches. The agreement between classical electrodynamic simulations of the microcavity response and the experimental data demonstrates that the entire microcavity stack can be controllably produced as designed. Promisingly, the refractive index of the inorganic/organic hybrid layers used in the microcavity DBRs can be precisely manipulated between values of 1.50 to 2.10. Hence, microcavities with a wide spectral range of optical modes might be designed and produced with straightforward coating methodologies, enabling fine-tuning of the energy and lifetime of the microcavities‘ optical modes to harness strong light–matter coupling in a wide variety of solution processable active materials. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

However, there is a need to establish the impact of such systems on plant growth and indoor climate and to optimize system tradeoffs. In this work, we consider plant growth under OSCs and system-relevant design. We evaluate the growth of red leaf lettuce under ST-OSC filters and compare the impact of three different OSC active layers that have unique transmittance. We find no significant differences in the fresh weight and chlorophyll content of the lettuce grown under these OSC filters. In addition, OSCs provide an opportunity for further light and thermal management of the greenhouse through device design and optical coatings. The OSCs can thus affect plant growth, power generation, and thermal load of the greenhouse, and this design trade space is reviewed and exemplified. © 2021 The Author(s); Adding semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) to greenhouses can reduce their energy footprint but may also affect plant growth. Ravishankar et al. demonstrate the negligible impact on lettuce grown under ST-OSCs. Furthermore, the trade-offs between solar power, plant growth, and climate control are considered. They show that active layer and electrode selection, along with the use of dielectric Bragg reflectors, provide broad spectral management to fully use the solar spectrum to optimize OSC-integrated greenhouses. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Correspondingly, enhanced transport properties are observed. Interestingly, these are found to be independent of lamellar thickness. In fact, within this family of molecules, characterized by a locked non-planar conformation and strong intramolecular charge localization, the orientational order within charge percolation paths was found to be the only factor dictating charge transport.

	abstract = {Electronic and optical properties of conjugated polymers are strongly affected by their solid-state microstructure. In nematic polymers, mesoscopic order and structure can be theoretically understood using Maier-Saupe (MS) models, motivating us to apply them to conjugated macromolecular systems and consider the problem of their material-specific parametrization. MS models represent polymers by worm-like chains (WLC) and can describe collective polymer alignment through anisotropic MS interactions. Their strength is controlled by a phenomenological temperature-dependent parameter, v(T). We undertake the challenging task of estimating material-specific v(T), combining experiments and Self-Consistent Field theory (SCFT). Considering three different materials and a spectrum of molecular weights, we cover the cases of rod-like, semiflexible, and flexible conjugated polymers. The temperature of the isotropic-nematic transition, TIN, is identified via polarized optical microscopy and spectroscopy. The polymers are mapped on WLC with temperature-dependent persistence length. Fixed persistence lengths are also considered, reproducing situations addressed in earlier studies. We estimate v(T) by matching TIN in experiments and SCFT treatment of the MS model. An important conclusion is that accounting explicitly for changes of persistence length with temperature has significant qualitative effects on v(T). We moreover correlate our findings with earlier discussions on the thermodynamic nature of phenomenological MS interactions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Blending offers a versatile processing platform to combine multiple properties in a given material system that may not be realized in one single component, or to induce co-operatively entirely new features. Polymers can, however, be challenging to blend due to their low tendency to mix, especially when processed from the melt. Here, we demonstrate that essentially the entire spectrum of phase morphologies, from basically fully intermixed to strongly phase-separated, can be induced reliably in blends produced from the archetypal polymer semiconductor, poly(3-hexyl thiophene), P3HT, and poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, a polymer that can exhibit ferroelectric polymorphs, despite the intrinsically limited miscibility featured by P3HT and PVDF. We achieve this by manipulating chain entanglements in solution, which in turn dictates the molecular mobility of the two components (i.e., mass transport during solidification), and in extreme cases leads to pronounced vitrification in the solid state. Since partly- to well-intermixed systems can be produced when processed from a good solvent for both components, we conclude that entanglements form between P3HT and PVDF molecules, provided their molecular weight and concentration is sufficiently high. Hence, specific phase morphologies can be targeted towards broad materials discovery via the establishment of reliable interrelationships between structure, phase morphology, and properties. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The targeted assembly of a wealth of functional architectures for soft photonics and electronics relies on a rigorous understanding of semiconducting polymer phase behavior. While many useful correlations have been established in the field of commodity plastics, unifying theories for their semiconducting counterparts are, however, more challenging to develop because of the rich phase behavior frequently displayed by these macromolecules, due in part to their complex chemical structures typically based on relatively rigid backbones and elaborate side-chain motifs. Solid-state structure formation and resulting properties are therefore especially sensitive to thermal and temporal parameters during processing, rendering device fabrication a challenging task that too often relies on time-consuming trial-and-error procedures. To understand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors of plastic semiconductor solidification and, for example, thin-film growth relevant for device fabrication, detailed knowledge of the intricacies of macromolecular semiconductors’ phase behavior must be gained and ideally combined with temperature/composition, temperature/confinement, and/or time/temperature/transformation- phase diagrams. This will open pathways toward a knowledge and methodology platform for the controlled materials assembly of soft electronics/photonics systems very much in analogy to the approaches used in metallurgy and the inorganic electronic materials field. In turn, a step change in how we design and process soft electronic products might be achieved, with impact on the broader soft matter area. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Organic solar cell blends comprised of an electron donating polymer and electron accepting fullerene typically form upon solution casting a thin-film structure made up of a complex mixture of phases. These phases can vary greatly in: composition, order and thermodynamic stability; and they are dramatically influenced by the processing history. Understanding the processes that govern the formation of these phases and their subsequent effect on the efficiency of photo-generating and extracting charge carriers is of utmost importance to enable rational design and processing of these blends. Here we show that the vitrifying effect of three fullerene derivatives ([60]PCBM, bis[60]PCBM, and [60]ICBA) on the prototypical donor polymer (rr-P3HT) can dominate microstructure formation of fullerene/donor polymer blends cast from solution. Using a dynamic crystallization model based on an amalgamation of Flory-Huggins and Lauritzen-Hoffman theory coupled to solvent evaporation we demonstrate that this vitrification, which can result in a large fraction of highly intermixed amorphous solid solution of the fullerene and the polymer, is due to kinetic and thermodynamic reasons. The former is partly determined by the glass transition temperature of the individual components while donor polymer:fullerene miscibility, strongly influenced by the chemical nature of the donor and the fullerene and leading to thermodynamic mixing, dictates the second phenomena. We show that our approximate dynamic crystallization model assists understanding the different solid-state structure formation of rr-P3HT:fullerene blends. Due to the generality of the assumptions used, our model should be widely applicable and assist to capture the influence of the different vitrification mechanisms also of other photovoltaic blends, including the high-efficiency systems based on the strongly aggregating PCE11 (PffBT4T-2OD), which also feature clear signs of vitirfication upon blending with, e.g., [60]PCBM. Hence, our model will provide essential materials design criteria and enable identification of suitable processing guidelines for existing and new high-performing blends from the outset. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Many typical organic optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and photovoltaic cells, use an ultrathin active layer where the organic semiconductor is confined within nanoscale dimensions. However, the question of how this spatial constraint impacts the active material is rarely addressed, although it may have a drastic influence on the phase behavior and microstructure of the active layer and hence the final performance. Here, the small-molecule semiconductor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is used as a model system to illustrate how sensitive this class of material can be to spatial confinement on device-relevant length scales. It is also shown that this effect can be exploited; it is demonstrated, for instance, that spatial confinement is an efficient tool to direct the crystal orientation and overall texture of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 structures in a controlled manner, allowing for the manipulation of properties including photoluminescence and charge transport characteristics. This insight should be widely applicable as the temperature/confinement phase diagrams established via differential scanning calorimetry and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction are used to identify specific processing routes that can be directly extrapolated to other functional organic materials, such as polymeric semiconductors, ferroelectrics or high-refractive-index polymers, to induce desired crystal textures or specific (potentially new) polymorphs. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This article provides a concise overview of characterization methods for teachers, students, non-specialists, and newcomers to polymer science as well as being a useful manual for researchers and technicians. Unlike pure low molar mass chemical substances, polymers are not composed of identical molecules. The macromolecules which comprise a single polymer sample vary from one another, primarily in terms of size and shape, but often also in the arrangement or positioning of atoms within macromolecules (e.g., chain branching, isomerism, etc.). Polymer properties are often drastically different from those of other substances and their characterization relies on specialist equipment and/or common equipment used in a specialized way (e.g., particular sample preparation or data analysis). This Brief Guide focuses uniquely on the structural characterization (i.e., analyzing the molecular and multi-molecular aspects) of polymers. The complex nature of the structural variables possible in macromolecular materials often presents a challenge with regard to the detailed structural characterization of polymers. This Brief Guide provides a useful starting point to direct the reader to the most commonly used and useful techniques to characterize these structural variables.  © 2023 IUPAC & De Gruyter.},

Combining the specific properties of commodity thermoplastics with the unique electrical and redox properties of conducting polymers (CPs) presents new opportunities for the field of printed (bio)electronics. Here, we report on the direct ink write (DIW) printing of ink formulations based on polyaniline-dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (PANI-DNNSA), which has been synthesized in bulk quantities (∼400 g). DNNSA imparts solubility to PANI up to 50 mg mL−1, which allows the use of various additives to tune the rheological behavior of the inks without significantly compromising the electrical properties of the printed structures, which reach conductivities in the range of <10−7-100 S cm−1 as a function of ink formulation and post treatment used. Fumed silica (FS) and ultra-high molecular weight polystyrene (UHMW-PS) additives are leveraged to endow printability and shape retention to inks, as well as to compare the use of traditional rheological modifiers with commodity thermoplastics on CP feedstocks for tailored DIW printing. We show that the incorporation of UHMW-PS into these ink formulations is critical for obtaining high crack resistance in printed structures. This work serves as a guide for future ink designs of CPs with commodity thermoplastics and their subsequent DIW printing to yield conductive architectures and devices for various applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of small-molecule bulk heterojunction solar cells is highly sensitive to the "ink" formulation used to produce the photoactive layer. Here we demonstrate that the addition of nucleating agents renders device fabrication notably less susceptible to the ink composition, promising a route toward more robust processing of efficient devices over large areas and enabling more facile materials screening. We selected as a model system blends of 7,7-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(5-hexyl-[2,2-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole](p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor because this is one of the small-molecule OPV blends with a device performance that is most sensitive to ink formulation, especially when used with the processing aid diiodooctane (DIO). Addition of DIO is essential to obtain high device performances; however, a notable increase in device performance is only achieved over a very narrow DIO content regime. Use of nucleating agents drastically changes this situation and leads to well-performing devices even at extreme levels of DIO. We thus start to address here one of the great challenges in organic solar cell research: the fact that, too often, only a very limited composition range leads to high efficiency devices. This means that for every new donor or acceptor a multitude of formulations have to be tested, including in combination with processing aids, to ensure that promising materials are not overlooked. The use of nucleating agents, thus, promises to render materials discovery more straightforward as this dependency of device performance with composition can be reduced. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer-based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de-doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3-(6-hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side-chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2-(3,3′-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (p[g2T-TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by <10% while that of p(g2T-TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de-doping while p(g2T-TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials-design toolbox for the creation of low-swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {The solution-processing of conjugated polymers, just like commodity polymers, is subject to solvent and molecular weight-dependent solubility, interactions and chain entanglements within the polymer, all of which can influence the crystallization and microstructure development in semi-crystalline polymers and consequently affect charge transport and optoelectronic properties. Disentanglement of polymer chains in marginal solvents was reported to work via ultrasonication, facilitating the formation of photophysically ordered polymer aggregates. In this contribution, we explore how a wide range of technologically relevant solvents and formulations commonly used in organic electronics influence chain entanglement and the aggregation behaviour of P3HT using a combination of rheological and spectrophotometric measurements. The specific viscosity of the solution offers an excellent indication of the degree of entanglements in the solution, which is found to be related to the solubility of P3HT in a given solvent. Moreover, deliberately disentangling the solution in the presence of solvophobic driving forces, leads consistently to formation of photophysically visible aggregates which is indicative of local and perhaps long range order in the solute. We show for a broad range of solvents and molecular weights that disentanglement ultimately leads to significant ordering of the polymer in the solid state and a commensurate increase in charge transport properties. In doing so we demonstrate a remarkable ability to tune the microstructure which has important implications for transport properties. We discuss its potential implications in the context of organic electronics and photovoltaics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of a novel 3,3′-difluoro-4,4′-dihexadecyl-2,2′-bithiophene monomer and its copolymerization with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to afford the fluorinated analogue of the well-known poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene) (PBTTT) polymer is reported. Fluorination is found to have a significant influence on the physical properties of the polymer, enhancing aggregation in solution and increasing melting point by over 100 C compared to nonfluorinated polymer. On the basis of DFT calculations these observations are attributed to inter and intramolecular S...F interactions. As a consequence, the fluorinated polymer PFBTTT exhibits a fourfold increase in charge carrier mobility compared to the nonfluorinated polymer and excellent ambient stability for a nonencapsulated transistor device. Backbone fluorination of the benchmark liquid crystalline polymer poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene) is shown to significantly influence its physical properties, substantially increasing the melting point and promoting aggregation. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this is related to a more coplanar backbone for the fluorinated polymer. Field effect transistor measurements show a fourfold increase in mobility upon fluorination. © 2015 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

	abstract = {Organic solar cell (OSC) bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) typically feature a rich phase morphology with the phase composition and distribution significantly affecting processes such as charge generation, recombination and extraction, and in turn, device performance. While fullerene-based BHJs are relatively well understood structurally, especially when blends with a flexible-chain donor are employed, donor: non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) blends are more challenging to elucidate. The reason is that NFAs often display different polymorphs; moreover, their glassy states can be complex. Focusing on blends of the widely investigated donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), and the prototype NFA, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), we reveal here the coexistence of two glassy phases: a molecularly intermixed and an ITIC-rich one. In P3HT-rich blends, both glassy phases are present as nanosized domains, evenly distributed in the BHJ, as visualized via vapor phase infiltration (VPI) "staining". In contrast, the 1:1 (by weight) and NFA-rich blends show clear, lateral phase separation between large (>500 nm) domains of the glassy phases and thinner polymer-rich domains that are unaffected by annealing. Our observations help to explain earlier P3HT: ITIC device studies; and also highlight the complexity of NFA-based BHJs, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the phase behavior of such systems.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (OMIECs) have the potential to enable diverse new technologies, ranging from biosensors to flexible energy storage devices and neuromorphic computing platforms. However, a study of these materials in their operating state, which convolves both passive and potential-driven solvent, cation, and anion ingress, is extremely difficult, inhibiting rational material design. In this report, we present a novel approach to the in situ studies of the electrochemical switching of a prototypical OMIEC based on oligoethylene glycol (oEG) substitution of semicrystalline regioregular polythiophene via grazing-incidence X-ray scattering. By studying the crystal lattice both dry and in contact with the electrolyte while maintaining potential control, we can directly observe the evolution of the crystalline domains and their relationship to film performance in an electrochemically gated transistor. Despite the oEG side-chain enabling bulk electrolyte uptake, we find that the crystalline regions are relatively hydrophobic, exhibiting little (less than one water per thiophene) swelling of the undoped polymer, suggesting that the amorphous regions dominate the reported passive swelling behavior. With applied potential, we observe that the π-πseparation in the crystals contracts while the lamella spacing increases in a balanced fashion, resulting in a negligible change in the crystal volume. The potential-induced changes in the crystal structure do not clearly correlate to the electrical performance of the film as an organic electrochemical transistor, suggesting that the transistor performance is strongly influenced by the amorphous regions of the film. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {The correlation between morphology and optoelectronic performance in organic thin-film transistors based on blends of photochromic diarylethenes (DAE) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated by varying molecular weight (Mw = 20–100 kDa) and regioregularity of the conjugated polymer as well as the temperature of thermal annealing (rt-160 °C) in thin films. Semicrystalline architectures of P3HT/DAE blends comprise crystalline domains, ensuring efficient charge transport, and less aggregated regions, where DAEs are located as a result of their spontaneous expulsion from the crystalline domains during the self-assembly. The best compromise between field-effect mobility (μ) and switching capabilities is observed in blends containing P3HT with Mw = 50 kDa, exhibiting μ as high as 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 combined with a >50% photoswitching ratio. Higher or lower Mw than 50 kDa are found to be detrimental for field-effect mobility and to lead to reduced device current switchability. The microstructure of the regioregular P3HT blend is found to be sensitive to the thermal annealing temperature, with an increase in μ and a decrease in current modulation being observed as a response to the light-stimulus likely due to an increased P3HT-DAE segregation, partially hindering DAE photoisomerization. The findings demonstrate the paramount importance of fine tuning the structure and morphology of bicomponent films for leveraging the multifunctional nature of optoelectronic devices. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A common solution is to mix micro-sized aluminum oxide particles into the epoxy, which improves the thermal performance. We compare this to an alternative approach: adding aluminum isopropoxide precursors, which could chemically react and bond to the epoxy chains at the molecular level. We compare both solutions experimentally and test the tensile strength, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity.

We review here the most important critical features that dictate polymer semiconductors’ melting temperatures, glass-transition temperatures and solid-to-solid transformations, such as liquid-crystalline transitions and transformations between polymorphs. We summarize classical polymer science tools to manipulate these phase transitions and discuss some key concepts such as nucleation and growth, spinodal decomposition, and confinement. We will show, first on single component systems then moving to multicomponent systems, that a detailed understanding of how to manipulate phase transitions and knowledge of temperature/composition diagrams (deduced for specific processing conditions) allows establishment of protocols to precisely direct the solidification process of relevant components, enables manipulation of the molecular order over various length scales, and permits tailoring of the overall phase ‘morphologies’ and solid-state microstructure. This opens a library of means to influence in a controlled fashion the electronic characteristics of semiconducting polymers; it also has many potential consequences, e.g., for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.

	abstract = {Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has long been regarded as an ideal piezoelectric 'plastic' because it exhibits a large piezoelectric response and a high thermal stability. However, the realization of piezoelectric PVDF elements has proven to be problematic due to, amongst other reasons, the lack of industrially scalable methods to process PVDF into the appropriate polar crystalline forms. Here, we show that fully piezoelectric PVDF films can be produced via a single-step process that exploits the fact that PVDF can be molded at temperatures below its melting temperature, i.e. via solid-state-processing. We demonstrate that we thereby produce δ-PVDF, the piezoelectric charge coefficient of which is comparable to that of biaxially stretched β-PVDF. We expect that the simplicity and scalability of solid-state processing combined with the excellent piezoelectric properties of our PVDF structures will provide new opportunities for this commodity polymer and will open a range of possibilities for future, large-scale, industrial production of plastic piezoelectric films. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Mixed ionic/electronic conducting polymers are versatile systems for, e.g., energy storage, heat management (exploiting electrochromism), and biosensing, all of which require electrochemical doping, i.e., the electrochemical oxidation or reduction of their macromolecular backbones. Electrochemical doping is achieved via electro-injection of charges (i.e., electronic carriers), stabilized via migration of counterions from a supporting electrolyte. Since the choice of the polymer side-chain functionalization influences electrolyte and/or ion sorption and desorption, it in turn affects redox properties, and, thus, electrochemically induced mixed conduction. However, our understanding of how side-chain versus backbone design can increase ion flow while retaining high electronic transport remains limited. Hence, heuristic design approaches have typically been followed. Herein, we consider the redox and swelling behavior of three poly(propylenedioxythiophene) derivatives, P(ProDOT)s, substituted with different side-chain motifs, and demonstrate that passive swelling is controlled by the surface polarity of P(ProDOT) films. In contrast, active swelling under operando conditions (i.e., under an applied bias) is dictated by the local side-chain free volume on the length scale of a monomer unit. Such insights deliver important design criteria toward durable soft electrochemical systems for diverse energy and biosensing platforms and new understanding into electrochemical conditioning (“break-in”) in many conducting polymers. © 2024 The Authors.

We find that substitution of the sulfur atoms in the thiophene rings of P3HT by heavy selenium atoms increases the tendency of the molecules to form better ordered phase; interestingly, their overall fraction of ordered phase is much lower than that of P3HT-based films. The higher tendency of P3HS molecules to order (aggregate) is consistent with more planar chain conformation simulated. The lower fraction of ordered phase (or the higher fraction of disordered phase) in P3HS-based films is clearly identified by in-plane skeleton Raman modes under resonant excitation conditions, such as a smaller ratio of the C=C modes associated with the ordered (∼1422 cm-1) and disordered (∼1446 cm-1) phases (I1422cm-1/I1446cm-1 = 1.4 for P3HS and 0.6 for P3HS:PCBM), compared with P3HT-based films (I 1449cm-1/I1470cm-1 = 2.5 for P3HT and 1.0 for P3HT:PCBM) and a larger Raman dispersion of the C=C mode: P3HS (17 cm-1) versus P3HT (6 cm-1) and P3HS:PCBM (36 cm-1) versus P3HT:PCBM films (23 cm-1). The higher fraction of disordered phase in P3HS prevents the formation of micrometer-sized PCBM aggregates in blend films during thermal annealing. Importantly, this lower fraction but better quality of ordered phase in P3HS molecules strongly influences P3HS:PCBM photovoltaic performance, producing smaller short-circuit current (Jsc) in pristine devices, but significantly larger increase in Jsc after annealing compared to P3HT:PCBM devices. Our results clarify the effects of heavy atom substitution in low band gap polymers and their impact on blend morphology and device performance. Furthermore, our study clearly demonstrates resonant Raman spectroscopy as a simple, but powerful, structural probe which provides important information about "fraction/quantity of ordered phase" of molecules, not easily accessible using traditional X-ray-based techniques. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {In polymeric semiconductors, charge carriers are polarons, which means that the excess charge deforms the molecular structure of the polymer chain that hosts it. This results in distinctive signatures in the vibrational modes of the polymer. Here, we probe polaron photogeneration dynamics at polymer:fullerene heterojunctions by monitoring its time-resolved resonance-Raman spectrum following ultrafast photoexcitation. We conclude that polarons emerge within 300 fs. Surprisingly, further structural evolution on ≤50-ps timescales is modest, indicating that the polymer conformation hosting nascent polarons is not significantly different from that near equilibrium. We interpret this as suggestive that charges are free from their mutual Coulomb potential because we would expect rich vibrational dynamics associated with charge-pair relaxation. We address current debates on the photocarrier generation mechanism at molecular heterojunctions, and our work is, to our knowledge, the first direct probe of molecular conformation dynamics during this fundamentally important process in these materials. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Electronic properties of organic semiconductors are often critically dependent upon their ability to order from the molecular level to the macro-scale, as is true for many other materials attributes of macromolecular matter such as mechanical characteristics. Therefore, understanding of the molecular assembly process and the resulting solid-state short- and long-range order is critical to further advance the field of organic electronics. Here, we will discuss the structure development as a function of molecular weight in thin films of a model conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), when processed from solution and the melt. While focus is on the microstructural manipulation and characterization, we also treat the influence of molecular arrangement and order on electronic processes such as charge transport and show, based on classical polymer science arguments, how accounting for the structural complexity of polymers can provide a basis for establishing relevant processing/structure/property-interrelationships to explain some of their electronic features. Such relationships can assist with the design of new materials and definition of processing protocols that account for the molecular length, chain rigidity and propensity to order of a given system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Electrospinning has proven to be a promising method to produce scaffolds for tissue engineering despite the frequently encountered limitations in 3-dimensional tissue formation due to a lack of cell infiltration. To fully unlock the potential of electrospun scaffolds for tissue engineering, the void space within the fibrous network needs to be increased substantially and in a controlled manner. Low-temperature electrospinning (LTE) increases the fiber to fiber distance by embedding ice particles as void spacers during fiber deposition. Scaffold porosities up to 99.5% can be reached and in line with the increase in void space, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds shift towards the range for native biological tissue. While both the physiological mechanical properties and high porosity were promising for tissue engineering applications, control of the porosity in three dimensions was still limited when using LTE methods. Based on a range of LTE spun scaffolds made of poly(lactic acid) and poly(ε-caprolactone), we found that changing the ratio between the rate of ice crystal formation and polymer fiber deposition only had a small effect on the 3D-porosity of the final scaffold architecture. Varying the fiber stiffness, however, offers considerable control over the scaffold void space. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We find that polarons are generated in these microstructures. However, the polarons generated in partially and predominantly non-intercalated films (1.7 eV) are at higher energy than in intercalated film (1.4 eV). After comparing with the polaron generation in neat pBTTT polymer film, we propose that the polarons generated in partially and predominantly non-intercalated film are delocalized charges, and the polarons generated in intercalated film are localized charges. Furthermore, we also find that the polarons generated in the partially non-intercalated film have the longest lifetime. © 2013 SPIE.},

Changes in crystalline domain size impact the yield and dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers. Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements show that neat polymer films composed of larger crystalline domains have longer photoconductance lifetimes and charge carrier yield decreases with increasing crystallite size for P3HT. Our results suggest that the classical polymer science description of temperature-dependent crystallization of polymers from solution can be used to understand thin-film formation in neat conjugated polymers, and hence, should be considered when discussing the structural evolution of organic bulk heterojunctions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Interestingly, the photoluminescence remains at the enhanced level for more than 71 h after treatment of the films by illumination with light, likely due to the fact that below the glass transition temperature no restoring force could return the conjugated chains into their initial conformational state. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

A typical small-molecular compound (6T) and two polymeric species P3HT and the liquid-crystalline PBTTT-C16, were selected.

In this paper we report a range of photophysical, electrochemical, physicochemical and structural data which provide evidence that formation of a relatively pure, molecularly ordered phase of the fullerene component, phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), may be the key factor driving the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in many of these devices. PCBM crystallisation is shown to result in an increase in its electron affinity, providing an energetic driving force for spatial separation of electrons and holes. Based upon our observations, we propose a functional model applicable to many organic bulk heterojunction devices based upon charge generation in a finely intermixed polymer/fullerene phase followed by spatial separation of electrons and holes at the interface of this mixed phase with crystalline PCBM domains. This model has significant implications for the design of alternative acceptor materials to PCBM for organic solar cells. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy show that the crystalline order of PCPDTBT increases when ODT is introduced in the solution phase either to neat polymer systems or to blends with [70]PCBM. The increased crystalline order is accompanied by less dispersive hole transport in the polymer, and leads to a more efficient formation of a percolating fullerene network within the blend. This contributes to an increase in photocurrent generation. However, the bimolecular recombination rate as determined from photovoltage transients increases upon addition of ODT, limiting the power conversion efficiency to values well below those expected from the energy levels of PCPDTBT. We propose some explanations for this increase in bimolecular recombination, based also on variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The thermal properties of K12 enable the film morphology to be controlled at easily accessible temperatures allowing the charge mobility to be tuned over two orders of magnitude. The electron mobility in the films was found to be independent of the initial processing conditions (solution or evaporation). The electron mobility measured in a FET configuration was of the order of 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for films prepared via either processing method whilst Photoinduced Charge Extraction in Linearly Increasing Voltage (PhotoCELIV) gave a mobility of order 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Preferential segregation of P3HT toward the film surface is observed for all blend compositions, while P3HT (or P3HT-rich) columnar structures enclosed by HDPE (or HDPE-rich) lamellar matrix is distinctive for 50:50 (by weight) blends. The transistors fabricated with P3HT:HDPE blend films show a clear field effect behavior, exhibiting charge carrier mobilities up to 5 10-2 cm2/Vs, comparable to the values reported in spin-coated similar blends and of neat P3HT devices.

	abstract = {Understanding charge generation by light absorption in polymeric semiconductors is of profound scientific importance due to the vigorous drive to develop organic solar cells. Confusion prevails with respect to the intrinsic charge photogeneration mechanism in neat (undoped) semicrystalline films. Numerous publications report charge photogeneration yields (the number of electron-hole pairs produced per absorbed photon) up to 30% on sub-picosecond timescales in neat regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) films. This is difficult to reconcile with the accepted picture that Frenkel excitons are the primary photoexcitations. Their binding energy is much higher than the lattice thermal energy at room temperature, such that direct charge generation ought to be improbable. Considering this, two fundamental questions arise: (i) what is the mechanism of direct charge photogeneration in semicrystalline polymer semiconductors? (ii) What is the role of solid-state microstructure in defining it? Here, we combine transient photoluminescence and absorption probes and find that charge photogeneration at 10 K occurs continuously over sub-nanosecond timescales, and not by a diffusion-limited exciton dissociation at defect sites. Rather, we conclude that it is an extrinsic process that occurs efficiently by dissociation of excitons localised at interfaces between crystalline and non-crystalline domains, and is driven by interfacial energetic disorder.},

	abstract = {The bulk-heterojunction nanostructure of non-crystalline polymer:fullerene blends has the tendency to rapidly coarsen when heated above its glass transition temperature, which represents an important degradation mechanism. We demonstrate that fullerene nucleating agents can be used to thermally arrest the nanostructure of photovoltaic blends that comprise a non-crystalline thiophene-quinoxaline copolymer and the widely used fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). To this end, C60 fullerene is employed to efficiently nucleate PCBM crystallization. Sub-micrometer-sized fullerene crystals are formed when as little as 2 wt% C60 with respect to PCBM is added to the blend. These reach an average size of only 200 nanometers upon introduction of more than 8 wt% C60. Solar cells based on C60-nucleated blends indicate significantly improved thermal stability of the bulk-heterojunction nanostructure even after annealing at an elevated temperature of 130 °C, which lies above the glass transition temperature of the blend. Moreover, we find that various other compounds, including C70 fullerene, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and sodium benzoate, as well as a number of commercial nucleating agents - commonly used to clarify isotactic polypropylene - permit to control crystallization of the fullerene phase. Fullerene nucleating agents are used to thermally arrest the nanostructure of photovoltaic blends that comprise a non-crystalline thiophene-quinoxaline copolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). In particular, C60 efficiently nucleates PCBM crystallization and reduces the size of fullerene crystals to only 200 nanometers.

The basic principles for harvesting electricity from a temperature gradient were first discovered around 180 years ago, but the contemporary technology utilising inorganic semiconductors was only developed since the early 1950s. The widespread use of this platform has so far been limited by a combination of relatively low efficiency in energy conversion or by issues related to the utilisation of rare, expensive and/or toxic elements that can be difficult to process. Recently much interest has been focused on the use of organic materials in thermoelectric devices, prompted by the possibility of developing large-area, low-cost devices. Considerable research in the last 20 years has been focused on understanding and improving organic thermoelectric properties, with remarkable progress recently published for compounds such as PEDOT and others.

Here we present a study of three soluble fullerenes with varying electron affinity to assess the impact of electronic structure on device performance and air stability. Through theoretical and experimental analysis of the electronic structure, characterization of thin-film structure, and characterization of transistor device properties we find that the air stability of the present series of fullerenes not only depends on the absolute electron affinity of the semiconductor but also on the disorder within the thin-film. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

By systematic variation of blend composition, solvent, and deposition temperature it is shown that much smoother blend films can be obtained than reported thus far. At a low PFO:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio the blend film consists of disk-shaped PFO domains embedded in a P(VDF-TrFE) matrix, while an inverted structure is obtained in case the P(VDF-TrFE) is the minority component. The microstructure of the phase separated blend films is self-affine. From this observation and from the domain size distribution it is concluded that the phase separation occurs via spinodal decomposition, irrespectively of blend ratio. This is explained by the strong incompatibility of the two polymers expressed by the binary phase diagram, as constructed from thermal analysis data. Time resolved numerical simulation of the microstructure evolution during de-mixing qualitatively shows how an elevated deposition temperature has a smoothening effect as a result of the reduction of the repulsion between the blend components. The small roughness allowed the realization of bistable rectifying diodes that switch at low voltages with a yield of 100%. This indicates that memory characteristics can be tailored from the outset while processing parameters can be adjusted according to the phase behavior of the active components. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The operation of resistive switches based on phase-separated blends of organic ferroelectrics and semiconductors depends significantly on the microstructure of such systems. A wide range of analysis techniques are used to characterize spin-coated films of the ferroelectric random copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)], and the semiconducting polymer, regio-irregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rir-P3HT). The blend separates into amorphous rir-P3HT domains embedded in a crystalline P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. The rir-P3HT domains are continuous throughout the film, from the substrate/blend interface to the blend/air interface. We also investigate the rir-P3HT domain size and number as a function of composition and find - unexpectedly - a rather mono-disperse domain size distribution for a given rir-P3HT:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio. The domain size increases with rir-P3HT content, indicating that the solidification is not dominated by nucleation processes. Spinodal decomposition is therefore more likely to be responsible for the microstructure induced in the rir-P3HT:P(VDF-TrFE) blends. Since spinodal decomposition occurs spontaneously without the presence of a nucleation step, this can facilitate processing considerably, since the intricate control of nucleation processes (homogenous or heterogenous) is rendered unnecessary. Measurement of the lateral conductivity of the blends demonstrates that the rir-P3HT domains are electrically not connected, supporting the microstructural evidence. A perpendicular current through the film is measured using both Au and Ag electrodes as a function of blend composition. A model was used to interpret the electrical transport. The injection for Ag diodes poled into the ON-state preferentially occurs at the circumference of the rir-P3HT domains. An accumulation width over which the injection occurs is estimated to be of the order of a few hundred nm. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

Based on ultrafast transient absorption, electro-absorption, and fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy, we find that exciton diffusion through relatively phase-pure polymer or fullerene domains limits the rate of electron and hole transfer, while prompt charge separation occurs in regions where the polymer and fullerene are molecularly intermixed (such as the co-crystal phase where fullerenes intercalate between polymer chains in pBTTT:PCBM). We moreover confirm the importance of neat domains, which are essential to prevent geminate recombination of bound electron-hole pairs. Most interestingly, using an electro-absorption (Stark effect) signature, we directly visualize the migration of holes from intermixed to neat regions, which occurs on the subpicosecond time scale. This ultrafast transport is likely sustained by high local mobility (possibly along chains extending from the co-crystal phase to neat regions) and by an energy cascade driving the holes toward the neat domains. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

These measurements were performed in the presence of a small, variable offset bias in unipolar and ambipolar samples, with and without an applied magnetic field. A reduction in mobility is observed in ambipolar samples at offset values above the turn-on voltage and is consistent with site blocking by triplet excitons. This is directly linked to the presence of electrically generated excited states by measuring the current-voltage-luminescence characteristics of such devices. The application of a ∼500mT magnetic field has the effect of increasing the measured mobility; an effect that is enhanced by the presence of excited states in ambipolar samples (from ∼3.2% below turn-on to ∼6.5% above), as opposed to the unipolar samples, where it remains constant independent of offset voltage. We thus conclude that the observed mobility enhancement with magnetic field in ambipolar structures is a result of a decrease in the concentration of site-blocking triplet states and provides direct measurement of a microscopic mechanism accounting for the phenomenon of organic magnetoresistance. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {The realization that modulated light pulses can be transported in a confined fashion over long distances within a structure that comprises a controlled spatial distribution of the refractive index n-as in optical fibres and waveguides-has, without doubt, underpinned the telecommunications revolution witnessed during the 20th century. The refractive index n, quantifying how light propagates in a given medium, as a consequence, has become one of the most important materials properties in designing photonics products. The other key characteristic for most optical and photonic applications is the amount of light that is absorbed by a material, expressed as the extinction coefficient κ. Although a range of organic/inorganic hybrid materials have been advanced with tunable refractive index, only a few systems combine a high n, sufficiently low κ and straightforward sample preparation to allow simple fabrication of highly transparent, low-loss structures. Here, we present a hybrid material that can be readily produced in water via a one-pot synthesis directly from commercially available, low-cost precursors. Moreover, our hybrid material can be solution-processed, yielding systems of an extinction coefficient <0.01, and a refractive index, which can be controlled to adopt values between 1.5 to at least 2.1. Unprecedentedly, simple post-deposition procedures such as thermal annealing or irradiation with high-intensity UV-light allow adjusting n also after film fabrication, offering an exceptional degree of freedom in designing and tailoring also more complex photonic architectures or planar wave-guides, for example, through creation of in-plane refractive index patterns. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate fabrication of waveguides based on local heating. The versatility of our materials is further illustrated by the production of lenses and dielectric filters of ∼100% reflectivity in a given wavelength regime. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the ferroelectric phase diagram of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The binary nonequilibrium temperature composition diagram was determined and melting of α- and β-phase PVDF was identified. Ferroelectric β-PVDF:PMMA blend films were made by melting, ice quenching, and subsequent annealing above the glass transition temperature of PMMA, close to the melting temperature of PVDF. Addition of PMMA suppresses the crystallization of PVDF and, as a consequence, the roughness of blend films was found to decrease with increasing PMMA content. Using time-dependent 2D numerical simulations based on a phase-field model, we qualitatively reproduced the effect of PMMA on the crystallization rate and the spherulite shape of PVDF. The remnant polarization scaled with the degree of crystallinity of PVDF. The thermal stability of the polarization is directly related to the Curie temperature. We show that, at high temperature, the commodity ferroelectric PVDF:PMMA blends outperform the commonly employed specialty copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)). © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Cornea implants consist of a clear optic portion with a surrounding ring known as the skirt, which needs to integrate with the sclera. However, currently used skirt materials lead to poor tissue integration. Improvements in this respect may be achieved by using a bioactive skirt material that adapts to the metabolic activity of the cornea. Polyether etherketone (PEEK) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) might provide interesting alternatives, if they can be rendered bioactive. We, therefore, investigated the potential of surface-modifying PEEK and UHMWPE films through the use of a two-step treatment. This process involved a suitable chemical surface modification (via immersion in NaOH), with subsequent formation of apatite layers on the polymers' surfaces through exposure to supersaturated simulated body fluid (1.5 SBF). In the present work the effect of 5 and 10MNaOH on formation of the apatite layer has been investigated with regard to wettability and topography features. In addition, the chemical stability of the apatite layer formed has been analyzed. Our data demonstrate that with an increase in NaOH concentration the wettability of the polymer increased, whilst some changes to the polymer film topography (increase/decrease in roughness) were observed. Most beneficially, the apatite layer that subsequently was grown on pre-treated PEEK and UHMWPE films through immersion in 1.5 SBF contained phosphate and carbonate ions, in similar ratios to those found in the apatite in dentine, thus, promising good in vivo bioactivity of these polymer films-a necessity if they are to be integrated into artificial cornea. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

So far, dewetting was known to proceed in the same manner, independent of the dewetting film being illuminated by light or not, e.g., through an optical microscope. Here, we demonstrate that the velocity of dewetting of conjugated polymers can be reversibly tuned through appropriate exposure to light. We relate this observation to the absorption of photons of suitable energy resulting in the generation of excitons which may partially delocalize along and across polymer chains and so induce changes in polymer chain conformation. Such changes, in turn, may cause stiffening or overlap of polymer chains and thus lead to macroscopically detectable differences in behavior of an ensemble of conjugated molecules expressed via material properties like viscosity. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The origin of this favorable characteristic of such architectures is investigated with three compounds that structurally differ only in the length of an alkyl spacer positioned between the molecular core and the active azobenzene chromophores. Species comprising spacers of sufficient length, and that exhibit a latent liquid-crystalline phase, feature efficient formation of stable, ordered domains in which the three side groups orient perpendicular to the polarization of the inscribing light beam. It is demonstrated that molecular order in these domains can be significantly improved by annealing at temperatures between the glass transition temperature and the clearing point of the specific compounds. This phenomenon allows combining the highly desirable processing characteristic of relatively short holographic writing times with small molecules in the fabrication of stable volume gratings, the latter feature so far having been reserved predominantly for polymeric species. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The optoelectronic properties of macromolecular semiconductors depend fundamentally on their solid-state microstructure and phase morphology. Hence, it is of central importance to manipulate - from the outset - the molecular arrangement and packing of this special class of polymers from the nano- to the micrometer scale when they are integrated in thin film devices such as photovoltaic cells, transistors or light-emitting diodes, for example. One effective strategy for this purpose is to vary their molecular weight. The reason for this is that materials of different weight-average molecular weight (Mw) lead to different microstructures. Polymers of low Mw form unconnected, extended-chain crystals because of their non-entangled nature. As a result, a polycrystalline, one-phase morphology is obtained. In contrast, high-Mw materials, in which average chain lengths are longer than the length between entanglements, form two-phase morphologies comprised of crystalline moieties embedded in largely un-ordered (amorphous) regions. Here, we discuss how changes in these structural features affect exciton dissociation processes. We utilise neat regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of varying Mw as a model system and apply time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to probe the electronic landscape in a range of P3HT thin-film architectures. We find that at 10 K, PL originating from recombination of long-lived charge pairs decays over microsecond timescales. Tellingly, both the amplitude and decay-rate distribution depend strongly on Mw. In films with dominant one-phase, chain-extended microstructures, the delayed PL is suppressed as a result of a diminished yield of photoinduced charges. Its decay is significantly slower than in two-phase microstructures. We therefore conclude that excitons in disordered regions between crystalline and amorphous phases dissociate extrinsically with yield and spatial distribution that depend intimately upon microstructure, in agreement with previous work [Paquin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2011, 106, 197401]. We note, however, that independent of Mw, the delayed-PL lineshape due to charge recombination is representative of that in low-Mw microstructures. We thus hypothesize that charge recombination at these low temperatures - and likely also charge generation - occur in torsionally disordered chains forming more strongly coupled photophysical aggregates than those in the steady-state ensemble, producing a delayed PL lineshape reminiscent of that in paraffinic morphologies at steady state. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Despite these advances, new opportunities are sought in order to widen the applications of organic-based technologies and expand their functionalities and features. For this purpose, use of multicomponent systems seems an interesting approach in view of, e.g., increasing the mechanical flexibility and stability of organic electronic products as well as introducing other features such as self-encapsulation. One specific strategy is based on blending polymeric insulators with organic semiconductors; which has led to a desired improvement of the mechanical properties of organic devices, producing in certain scenarios robust and stable architectures. Here we discuss the working principle of semiconductor:insulator blends, examining the different approaches that have recently been reported in literature. We illustrate how organic field-effect transistors (OFET)s and organic solar cells (OPV)s can be fabricated with such systems without detrimental effects on the resulting device characteristics even at high contents of the insulator. Furthermore, we review the various properties that can be enhanced and/or manipulated by blending including air stability, mechanical toughness, H- vs. J-aggregation, etc. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

	abstract = {The bis and tris adducts of [6,6]phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) offer lower reduction potentials than PCBM and are therefore expected to offer larger open-circuit voltages and more efficient energy conversion when blended with conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices in place of PCBM. However, poor photovoltaic device performances are commonly observed when PCBM is replaced with higheradduct fullerenes. In this work, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM), steady-state and ultrafast time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to probe the microstructural properties of blend films of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with the bis and tris adducts of PCBM. TEM and PL indicate that, in as-spun blend films, fullerenes become less soluble in P3HT as the number of adducts increases. PL indicates that upon annealing crystallization leads to phase separation in P3HT:PCBM samples only. DSC studies indicate that the interactions between P3HT and the fullerene become weaker with higher-adduct fullerenes and that all systems exhibit eutectic phase behavior with a eutectic composition being shifted to higher molar fullerene content for higher-adduct fullerenes. We propose two different mechanisms of microstructure development for PCBM and higher-adduct fullerenes. P3HT:PCBM blends, phase segregation is the result of crystallization of either one or both components and is facilitated by thermal treatments. In contrast, for blends containing higher adducts, the phase separation is due to a partial demixing of the amorphous phases. We rationalize the lower photocurrent generation by the higher-adduct fullerene blends in terms of film microstructure. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The assembly and the orientation of functionalized pentacene at the interface with inorganics strongly influence both the electric contact and the charge transport in organic electronic devices. In this study electronic spectroscopies and theoretical modeling are combined to investigate the properties of the bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-Pc)/Au(111) interface as a function of the molecular coverage to compare the molecular state in the gas phase and in the adsorbed phase and to determine the thermal stability of TIPS-Pc in contact with gold. Our results show that in the free molecule only the acene atoms directly bonded to the ligands are affected by the functionalization. Adsorption on Au(111) leads to a weak coupling which causes only modest binding energy shifts in the TIPS-Pc and substrate core level spectra. In the first monolayer the acene plane form an angle of 33 ± 2° with the Au(111) surface at variance with the vertical geometry reported for thicker solution-processed or evaporated films, whereas the presence of configurational disorder was observed in the multilayer. The thermal annealing of the TIPS-Pc/Au(111) interface reveals the ligand desorption at ∼470 K, which leaves the backbone of the decomposed molecule flat-lying on the metal surface as in the case of the unmodified pentacene. The weak interaction with the metal substrate causes the molecular dissociation to occur 60 K below the thermal decomposition taking place in thick drop-cast films. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {An understanding of aggregation effects in semiconducting polymers is essential for their use in optoelectronic devices; however, the dynamic evolution of such interchain states is not well understood. Here, we have investigated a blend of semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with an electronically inert ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) matrix that is shown to allow precise control over the extent to which the P3HT chains aggregate. We determined the singlet exciton population within isolated and aggregated P3HT regions using femtosecond time-resolved photoluminescence measurements and found a strong ultrafast decay pathway in the aggregated case only. Comparison of the emission from the two lowest vibronic bands demonstrates a changeover from an initial vibrationally "hot" photoexcited state to a geometrically relaxed aggregate state within ∼13 ps, corresponding to time scales for torsional relaxation in these materials. We conclude that formation of an aggregate excited state in conjugated polymers is mediated by vibrational relaxation from a low-symmetry to a high-symmetry ordered state for the ensemble. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Specifically, we compare an essentially fully intermixed, one-phase system based on a 1 : 1 (by weight) pBTTT-C16 : PC61BM blend, known to form a co-crystal structure, with a two-phase morphology composed of relatively material-pure domains of the neat polymer and neat fullerene. The co-crystal occurs at a composition of up to 50 wt% PC61BM, because pBTTT-C16 is capable of hosting fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM in the cavities between its side chains. In contrast, the predominantly two-phase system can be obtained by manipulating a 1 : 1 polymer : fullerene blend with the assistance of a fatty acid methyl ester (dodecanoic acid methyl ester, Me12) as additive, which hinders co-crystal formation. We find that triplet excitons and polarons are generated in both phase morphologies. However, polarons are generated in the predominantly two-phase system at higher photon energy than for the structure based on the co-crystal phase. By means of a quasi-steady-state solution of a mesoscopic rate model, we demonstrate that the steady-state polaron generation efficiency and recombination rates are higher in the finely intermixed, one-phase system compared to the predominantly phase-pure, two-phase morphology. We suggest that the polarons generated in highly intermixed structures, such as the co-crystal investigated here, are localised polarons while those generated in the phase-separated polymer and fullerene systems are delocalised polarons. We expect this picture to apply generally to other organic-based heterojunctions of complex phase morphologies including donor:acceptor systems that form, for instance, molecularly mixed amorphous solid solutions, underlining the generality of the understanding gained here. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Side-chain engineering is increasingly being utilized as a technique to impact the structural order and enhance the electronic properties of semiconducting polymers. However, the correlations drawn between structural changes and the resulting charge transport properties are typically indirect and qualitative in nature. In the present work, a combination of grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and crystallographic refinement calculations is used to determine the precise molecular packing structure of two thiophene-based semiconducting polymers to study the impact of side-chain modifications. The optimized structures provide high-quality fits to the experimental data and demonstrate that in addition to a large difference in interchain spacing between the two materials, there exists a significant disparity in backbone orientation as well. The calculated structures are utilized in density functional theory calculations to determine the band structure of the two materials and are shown to exhibit a dramatic disparity in interchain dispersion which accounts for the large observed difference in charge carrier mobility. The techniques presented here are meant to be general and are therefore applicable to many other highly diffracting semicrystalline polymers. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

	abstract = {The influence of solid-state microstructure on the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers is widely recognized, but still poorly understood. Here, we show how the microstructure of conjugated polymers controls the yield and decay dynamics of long-lived photogenerated charge in neat films. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) was used as a model system. By varying the molecular weight, we drive a transition in the polymer microstructure from nonentangled, chain-extended, paraffinic-like to entangled, semicrystalline (MW = 5.5-347 kg/mol). The molecular weight range at which this transition occurs (MW = 40-50 kg/mol) can be deduced from the drastic change in elongation at break found in tensile tests. Linear absorption measurements of free-exciton bandwidth and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements of transient photoconductance track the concomitant evolution in optoelectronic properties of the polymer as a function of MW. TRMC measurements show that the yield of free photogenerated charge increases with increasing molecular weight in the paraffinic regime and saturates at the transition into the entangled, semicrystalline regime. This transition in carrier yield correlates with a sharp transition in free-exciton bandwidth and decay dynamics at a similar molecular weight. We propose that the transition in microstructure controls the yield and decay dynamics of long-lived photogenerated charge. The evolution of a semicrystalline structure with well-defined interfaces between amorphous and crystalline domains of the polymer is required for spatial separation of the electron and hole. This structural characteristic not only largely controls the yield of free charges, but also serves as a recombination center, where mobile holes encounter a bath of dark electrons resident in the amorphous phase and recombine with quasi first-order kinetics. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

No correlation with the particle size and optical response is found, indicating that it is the pre-assembly in the initial emulsion and possibly additional features such as the thermoresponsiveness of one of the macrosurfactants that lead to the specific molecular arrangement of the P3HT. Considering the broad variety of macrosurfactants that can be synthesised based already on the building blocks (co-polymer units) used here, it is clear that this approach can widen the tool box towards structural control of organic semiconductors, and macromolecular materials especially.

As a consequence, a detailed understanding of how to manipulate molecular ordering, e.g., through knowledge of relevant phase transitions, of the solidification process, of relevant solidification mechanisms, and of kinetic factors, is required to induce the desired optoelectronic response. In this review, we discuss relevant structural features of single-component and multicomponent systems; provide a case study of the multifaceted structure that polymer:fullerene systems can adopt; and highlight relevant solidification mechanisms such as nucleation and growth, liquid-liquid phase separation, and spinodal decomposition.

	abstract = {Despite the promise of photochemical upconversion as a means to extend the light-harvesting capabilities of a range of photovoltaic solar energy conversion devices, it remains a challenge to create efficient, solid-state upconverting materials. Until now, a material has yet to be found which is as efficient as a liquid composition. Here, a gelated photochemical upconversion material is reported with a performance indistinguishable from an otherwise identical liquid composition. The sensitizer phosphorescence lifetime, Stern-Volmer quenching constants and upconversion performance (6% under one-sun illumination) were all found to be unchanged in a quasi-solid gelated sample when compared to the liquid sample. The result paves the way to a new family of efficient photochemical upconversion materials comprised of macroscopically solid, but microscopically liquid gel, for application in photovoltaics and photocatalytic water-splitting. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

	abstract = {Organic transistors based on blends of 2,8-difluoro-5,11- bis(triethylsilylethynyl) anthradithiophene (diF-TES ADT) and poly(triarylamine) [PTAA] are strong candidates for application in future large-volume organic electronics because of their record breaking carrier mobility and environmental stability. Here we report on the dependence of hole transport on the composition of diF-TES ADT:PTAA blends. Maximum mobility is obtained only for blends containing ≥39 wt.% diF-TES ADT. At compositions below this threshold the hole mobility is drastically reduced and is found to be equal to that of the neat polymer matrix, i.e. PTAA (∼10-3 cm2/V s). Scanning atomic force and polarised light microscopy, combined with differential scanning calorimetry, show that this threshold corresponds to the appearance of crystalline, acene-rich regions in such blend films, and the formation of high mobility conduction pathways between the source and drain electrodes. The dependence of hole mobility on diF-TES ADT concentration can be modelled using a simple percolation model. The present results provide important insights into the microstructure evolution in this high performance semiconducting blend and could prove valuable for the development of the next generation organic transistors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Polycrystalline tris(8-hydroxyquinolate)gallium shows a similar behavior. The observed eSR for these molecules is no greater than 0.85 MHz at 300 K. The variety of crystal structures and transport regimes that these molecules possess, as well as the local nature of the probe, strongly suggest an intramolecular phenomenon general to many organic semiconductors, in contrast to the commonly assumed spin relaxation models based on intermolecular charge-carrier transport. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

The calorimetric studies reveal a distinct increase of the melting temperature of the high-pressure-crystallized polymer, from 235 to 248°C for P3HT. The results also show that pressure-induced crystallization result in an increase of the crystal thickness of up to 65% for the higher molecular weight material, while an increase of more than 15% is observed for the P3HT of 60 kg mol-1. For the lower-molecular-weight material, the enhancement in charge-carrier mobility in pressure solidified materials is found to be less pronounced.},

Changes in the measured field-effect mobility of holes and electrons are shown to reveal relevant information about the phase-segregation in this system, which are in agreement with a eutectic phase behavior. Using dual-gate OFETs and in-situ measurements, it is demonstrated that the spatial- and time-dependence of microstructural changes in such polymer:fullerene blend films can also be probed. A percolation-theory-based simulation is carried out to illustrate how phase-segregation in this system is expected to lead to a substantial decrease in the electron conductivity in an OFET channel, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The evolution of the solid-state microstructure of binary P3HT:PC61BM blend films upon annealing is monitored using field-effect measurements.

	abstract = {Concurrence of the vibrational coherence and ultrafast electron transfer has been observed in polymer/fullerene blends. However, it is difficult to experimentally investigate the role that the excited-state vibrational coherence plays during the electron transfer process since vibrational coherence from the ground- and excited-electronic states is usually temporally and spectrally overlapped. Here, we performed 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) measurements on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films. By Fourier transforming the whole 2D ES datasets (S (λ 1, T∼ 2, λ 3)) along the population time (T∼ 2) axis, we develop and propose a protocol capable of separating vibrational coherence from the ground- and excited-electronic states in 3D rephasing and nonrephasing beating maps (S (λ 1, ν∼ 2, λ 3)). We found that the vibrational coherence from pure excited electronic states appears at positive frequency (+ ν∼ 2) in the rephasing beating map and at negative frequency (- ν∼ 2) in the nonrephasing beating map. Furthermore, we also found that vibrational coherence from excited electronic state had a long dephasing time of 244 fs. The long-lived excited-state vibrational coherence indicates that coherence may be involved in the electron transfer process. Our findings not only shed light on the mechanism of ultrafast electron transfer in organic photovoltaics but also are beneficial for the study of the coherence effect on photoexcited dynamics in other systems. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Analogous to conventional inorganic semiconductors, the performance of organic semiconductors is directly related to their molecular packing, crystal- linity, growth mode, and purity. In order to achieve the best possible performance, it is critical to understand how organic semiconductors nucleate and grow. Clever use of surface and dielectric modification chemistry can allow one to control the growth and morphology, which greatly influence the electrical properties of the organic transistor. In this Review, the nucleation and growth of organic semiconductors on dielectric surfaces is addressed. The first part of the Review concentrates on small-molecule organic semiconductors. The role of deposition conditions on film formation is described. The modification of the dielectric interface using polymers or self-assembled monolayers and their effect on organic-semiconductor growth and performance is also discussed. The goal of this Review is primarily to discuss the thin-film formation of organic semiconducting species. The patterning of single crystals is discussed, while their nucleation and growth has been described elsewhere (see the Review by Liu et. al).[] The second part of the Review focuses on polymeric semiconductors. The dependence of physicochemical properties, such as chain length (i.e., molecular weight) of the constituting macromolecule, and the influence of small molecular species on, e.g., melting temperature, as well as routes to induce order in such macro- molecules, are described. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this review, we discuss the latest findings related to the structure/optoelectronic properties interrelationships that exist in organic devices fabricated with conjugated polymers in terms of charge mobility, absorption, photoluminescence, as well as photovoltaic properties. © 2014 by the authors.},

Pronounced J-like aggregation behavior, characteristic for systems of a low exciton band width, was found for blends where the most pronounced liquid-liquid phase separation occurred in solution, leading to domains of P3HT and PEO of high phase purity. Since liquid-liquid phase separation could be readily manipulated either by the solution temperature, solute concentration, or deposition temperature, to name a few parameters, our findings promise the design from the out-set of semiconductor:insulator architectures of pre-defined properties by manipulation of the interaction parameter between the solutes as well as the respective solute:solvent system using classical polymer science principles. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Polymer blends are broadly important in chemical science and chemical engineering and have led to a wide range of commercial products, however their precise structure and phase morphology is often not well understood. Here we show for the first time that π-conjugated polytellurophenes and high-density polyethylene form blends that can serve as active layers in field-effect transistor devices and can be characterized by a variety of element-specific imaging techniques such as STEM and EDX. Changing the hydrocarbon content and degree of branching on the polytellurophene side-chain leads to a variety of blend structures, and these variations can be readily visualized. Characterization by electron microscopy is complemented by topographic and X-ray methods to establish a nano- to micro-scale picture of these systems. We find that blends that possess microscale networks function best as electronic devices; however, contrary to previous notions a strong correlation between nanofiber formation and electrical performance is not observed. Our work demonstrates that use of organometallic polymers assists in clarifying relevant structure-property-function relationships in multicomponent systems such as semiconductor:insulator blends and sheds light on the structure development in polymer:polymer blends including crystallization, phase separation, and formation of supramolecular arrangements.

	abstract = {Light-induced charge formation is essential for the generation of photocurrent in organic solar cells. In order to gain a better understanding of this complex process, we have investigated the femtosecond dynamics of charge separation upon selective excitation of either the fullerene or the polymer in different bulk heterojunction blends with well-characterized microstructure. Blends of the pBTTT and PBDTTPD polymers with PCBM gave us access to three different scenarios: either a single intermixed phase, an intermixed phase with additional pure PCBM clusters, or a three-phase microstructure of pure polymer aggregates, pure fullerene clusters and intermixed regions. We found that ultrafast charge separation (by electron or hole transfer) occurs predominantly in intermixed regions, while charges are generated more slowly from excitons in pure domains that require diffusion to a charge generation site. The pure domains are helpful to prevent geminate charge recombination, but they must be sufficiently small not to become exciton traps. By varying the polymer packing, backbone planarity and chain length, we have shown that exciton diffusion out of small polymer aggregates in the highly efficient PBDTTPD:PCBM blend occurs within the same chain and is helped by delocalization.

	abstract = {The role of the substrate temperature on the structural, optical, and electronic properties of ZnO thin films deposited by spray pyrolysis using a zinc acetate precursor solution is reported. Analysis of the precursor compound using thermogravimentry and differential scanning calorimetry indicates complete decomposition of the precursor at around 350 °C. Film characterization using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) optical transmission spectroscopy suggests the onset of ZnO growth at temperatures as low as 100 °C as well as the transformation to a polycrystalline phase at deposition temperatures >200 °C. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that as-deposited films exhibit low surface roughness (rms ≈ 2.9 nm at 500 °C) and a crystal size that is monotonously increasing from 8 to 32 nm for deposition temperatures in the range of 200-500 °C. The latter appears to have a direct impact on the field-effect electron mobility, which is found to increase with increasing ZnO crystal size. The maximum mobility and current on/off ratio is obtained from thin-film transistors fabricated using ZnO films deposited at >400 °C yielding values on the order of 25 cm 2 V-1s-1 and 106, respectively. The evolution of the structural and electronic properties of ZnO films grown by spray pyrolysis as a function of deposition temperature is reported. It is established that higher deposition temperatures lead to the formation of larger ZnO crystalline domains and the fabrication of n-channel thin-film transistors with significantly improved operating characteristics. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The microstructure of blend fi lms of conjugated polymer and fullerene, especially the degree of mixing and crystallization, impacts the performance of organic photovoltaic devices considerably. Mixing and crystallization affect device performance in different ways. These phenomena are not easy to screen using traditional methods such as imaging. In this paper, the amorphous regiorandom poly(3-hexylthiophene) is blended with the potentially crystalline fullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester PCBM and the amorphous bis-adduct. First, the degree of mixing of polymer: fullerene blends is evaluated using UV-Vis absorption, steady-state and ultra-fast photoluminescence spectroscopy. The blue-shift of the polymer emission and absorption onset are used in combination with the saturation of the polymer emission decay time upon fullerene addition in order to infer the onset of aggregation of the blends. Second, the crystallinity of the fullerene is probed using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the red-shift of charge transfer emission in the case of PCBM based blends cannot be explained solely by a variation of optical dielectric constant as probed by VASE. A combination of optical spectroscopy techniques, therefore, allows to probe the degree of mixing and can also distinguish between aggregation and crystallization of fullerenes. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The electronic properties of macromolecular semiconductor thin films depend profoundly on their solid-state microstructure, which in turn is governed, among other things, by the processing conditions selected and the polymer's chemical nature and molecular weight. Specifically, low-molecular-weight materials form crystalline domains of cofacially π-stacked molecules, while the usually entangled nature of higher-molecular-weight polymers leads to microstructures comprised of molecularly ordered crystallites interconnected by amorphous regions. Here, we examine the interplay between extended exciton states delocalized along the polymer backbones and across polymer chains within the π stack, depending on the structural development with molecular weight. Such two-dimensional excitations can be considered as Frenkel excitons in the limit of weak intersite coupling. We combine optical spectroscopies, thermal probes, and theoretical modeling, focusing on neat poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) - one of the most extensively studied polymeric semiconductors - of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 3-450 kg/mol. In thin-film structures of high-molecular-weight materials (Mw > 50 kg/mol), a balance of intramolecular and intermolecular excitonic coupling results in high exciton coherence lengths along chains (∼4.5 thiophene units), with interchain coherence limited to ∼2 chains. In contrast, for structures of low-Mw P3HT (<50 kg/mol), the interchain exciton coherence is dominant (∼30% higher than in architectures formed by high-molecular-weight materials). In addition, the spatial coherence within the chain is significantly reduced (by nearly 25%). These observations give valuable structural information; they suggest that the macromolecules in aggregated regions of high-molecular-weight P3HT adopt a more planar conformation compared to low-molecular-weight materials. This results in the observed increase in intrachain exciton coherence. In contrast, shorter chains seem to lead to torsionally more disordered architectures. A rigorous, fundamental description of primary photoexcitations in π-conjugated polymers is hence developed: two-dimensional excitons are defined by the chain-length dependent molecular arrangement and interconnectivity of the conjugated macromolecules, leading to interplay between intramolecular and intermolecular spatial coherence. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Recently, an intermixed phase has been identified within organic photovoltaic (OPV) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems that can exist in addition to relatively phase-pure regions, highlighting the need for a refined picture of the solid-state microstructure of donor-acceptor blends and for gaining further understanding of the exact nature and role such intermixed phases play in such devices. Here we manipulate the microstructure of polymer-fullerene systems via processing means and the selection of the molecular weight of the donor polymer. This manipulation is used as a tool to vary the fraction of intermixed phase present and its effects on the structure and subsequently the opto-electronic processes. We find clear relationships between the state of mixing and amount of exciton quenching and number of polarons generated per absorbed photon. Furthermore, we observe that blend systems incorporating higher molecular weight polymer result in a greater yield of dissociated polarons, likely due to the increase of the intermixed fraction. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Additives, including nucleating agents, have been used to regulate the solidification process of (semi-)crystalline polymer solids and thus control both their crystallite dimensions and shape. Here, we demonstrate that minute amounts (0.1-1 wt%) of commercially available nucleating agents can be used to efficiently manipulate the solidification kinetics of a wide range of organic semiconductors - including poly(3-alkylthiophene)s, the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and 6,13-bis(triisopropyl- silylethynyl) (TIPS) pentacene - when processed from the melt, solution or solid state, without adversely affecting the semiconductors' electronic properties. Heterogeneous nucleation increases the temperature of and rate of crystallization of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s, permits patterning of crystallites at pre-defined locations in PCBM, and minimizes dewetting of films of TIPS-pentacene formed by inkjet printing. Nucleating agents thus make possible the fabrication of thin-film transistors with uniform electrical characteristics at high yield. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Both polymer and polymer:PCBM blend solutions were prepared using chlorobenzene and stirred for 24 h to fully dissolve the polymer. P3HT:PCBM and P3HS:PCBM blend films (1:1) were spin-coated onto quartz substrates from warm solutions. Because of low solubility of P3HS P3HS:PCBM films were spin-coated onto substrates that were 80°C. All films were deposited in a clean room with a filtered air environment. Some blend films were thermally annealed at 140°C for 30 mm in a dry nitrogen environment. The result show that fine control of blend film microstructure through the self-organizing properties of the component materials is essential to realize the potential of new organic photovoltaic materials.},

	abstract = {The skirt of an artificial cornea must integrate the implant to the host sclera, a major failure of present devices. Thus, it is highly desirable to encourage the metabolic activity of the cornea by using more bioactive, flexible skirt materials. Here we describe attempts to increase the bioactivity of polyether ether ketone (PEEK), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) films. The effectiveness of different strength NaOH pre-treatments to initiate apatite deposition on PEEK, HDPE and UHMWPE is investigated. We find that exposure of PEEK, HDPE and UHMWPE films to NaOH solutions induces the formation of potential nuclei for apatite (calcium phosphate), from which the growth of an apatite coating is stimulated when subsequently immersing the polymer films in 1.5 strength Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). As immersion time in SBF increases, further nucleation and growth produces a thicker and more compact apatite coating that can be expected to be highly bioactive. Interestingly, the apatite growth is found to also be dependent on both the concentration of NaOH solution and the structure of the polymer surface. © 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.},

The nature of the structures obtained from the melt was found to generally be dictated by crystallization of the PE block, which solidified after the P3HT sequence. This resulted in the formation of classical spherulitic structures for diblock copolymers of low P3HT content. At P3HT contents exceeding 10-20 wt%, the semiconductor block increasingly hampered crystallization of the PE moiety, with the P3HT entity arranging into columnar and at higher content into lamellar micelle-type domains. Unlike the rate of crystal growth of the two moieties, interestingly, the dimensionality of both entities of the diblock copolymers was found to be unaffected by the presence of the dissimilar block.

The presence of excited states reduces the room temperature hole mobility (typically 5× 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1) by as much as 15% compared to that measured without offset, in contrast to the hole only devices where no significant mobility reduction is seen at the same, or indeed higher, current densities.

It is demonstrated that for optimal performance it is critical to design chemical structures that allow formation of both an amorphous and a liquid-crystalline phase. In the present approach, the liquid-crystalline feature was introduced by inserting decoupling spacers between a trisfunctionalized benzene core and the three azobenzene moieties, as well as adding polar end groups to the latter. To compensate for the deleterious reduction of the glass transition temperature associated with the spacers in the compounds, polar units were incorporated between the benzene core and the side groups. Intriguingly, the molecular glasses that feature a latent liquid-crystalline phase display a remarkable "postdevelopment", i.e., an increase of the amplitude of refractive index modulation in holographic experiments after writing of optical gratings is arrested, exceeding 20% for the previously mentioned derivative. Thus, these nonpolymeric, azobenzene- containing compounds presented in this work appear to be attractive candidates for fabrication of stable holographic volume gratings. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

However, for technological exploitation, it is imperative not to be confined to the tedious growth and cumbersome manipulation of molecular crystals - which generally show notoriously poor mechanical properties - but to be able to process such materials into robust architectures by simple and efficient means. Here, we advance a general route for facile fabrication of thin-film devices from solution. The key beneficial feature of our process - and the principal difference from existing vapour deposition5-7 and solution-processing schemes7-10 - is the incorporation of a glass-inducing diluent that enables controlled crystallization from an initial vitreous state of the organic semiconductor, formed in a selected area of the phase diagram of the two constituents. We find that the vitrifying diluent does not adversely affect device performance. Indeed, our environmentally stable, discrete rubrene-based transistors rival amorphous silicon devices, reaching saturated mobilities of up to 0.7 cm 2 V-1 s-1, ON-OFF ratios of ≥ 106 and subthreshold slopes as steep as 0.5 V per decade. A nearly temperature-independent device mobility, indicative of a high crystalline quality of our solution-processed, rubrene-based films11, corroborates these findings.

	abstract = {Time of flight photocurrent transient studies on thin films of bimodal polytriarylamine (PTAA) show two distinct and separate arrival times for hole transport in the same sample at a single field. The corresponding mobilities differ by two orders of magnitude, typically μfast ∼ 10-3 cm2 V-1 S-1 and μslow ∼ 10-5 cm2 V-1 S-1 at room temperature, and are measured parametric in electric field and temperature. The mobility data are analyzed using the correlated disorder model by Novikov, yielding a fitting parameter set. The two conduction paths are believed to come about as a result of phase segregation between the shorter and longer polymer chains with the shorter chains giving rise to the faster conduction pathways (as confirmed by results obtained for monomodal, shorter, and longer chain PTAA, by sample thickness scaling of the photocurrents and by reversal of the illuminated electrode). Separate arrival times are also obtained in a blend of the two short and long chain monomodal polymers. The phase separation within the film is inferred by the appearance of two glass transition temperatures using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes) (pBTTTs) - currently one of the most promising class of polymer semiconductors - are known to have a low-room-temperature solubility in a broad range of common organic solvents. By judicious selection of a suitable solvent for these rigid-rod-like, liquid-crystalline materials, we ink-jet printed poly(2,5-bis(3- dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pBTTT-C12) into discrete thin-film field-effect transistors (FETs) that display on/off ratios of up to 107 and charge-carrier mobilities in the range of 0.05-0.1 cm2 V-1 s-1. Compared to spin-coated devices, the ink-jet printed devices typically had lower current leakage; indeed, gate-leakage currents were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower in ink-jet printed transistors. These overall device performance of ink-jet printed pBTTT-C 12 would be sufficient for, for instance, driving simple electrophoretic displays [T. N. Ng, S. Sambandan, R. Lujan, A. C. Arias, C. R. Newman, H. Yan and A. Facchetti, Appl. Phys. Lett., 2009, 94, 233307; G. H. Gelinck, T. C. T. Geuns and D. M. de Leeuw, Appl. Phys. Lett., 2000, 77, 1487-1489; H. E. A. Huitema, G. H.

This is one of the highest gains reported for a unipolar-based logic gate and demonstrates the potential of pBTTT polymers for high performance application employing simple ink-jet printing procedures conducted in light and ambient air without any special precautions. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {A simple rationale for selecting the optimum composition of binary organic photovoltaic crystalline/crystalline polymer/small molecule blends was proposed. A unique relationship between the composition dependence of photocurrent generation and microstructure, controlled by the phase behavior of the two crystalline components, was also demonstrated. The rate of solidification is found to be critical for the P3HT/PC61BM binary when processed both from solution and the melt. The devices display a maximum short circuit photocurrent, which is maximized for blend films after thermal treatment at 140°C for 45 min. The binary systems are also found to be of simple eutectic in nature, featuring different eutectic compositions and temperatures. Optical measurements of dielectric function indicate that the effect of blend composition on the Columbic binding energy for a polaron pair in an effective medium is small.},

	abstract = {Blends and other multicomponent systems are used in various polymer applications to meet multiple requirements that cannot be fulfilled by a single material. In polymer optoelectronic devices it is often desirable to combine the semiconducting properties of the conjugated species with the excellent mechanical properties of certain commodity polymers. Here we investigate bicomponent blends comprising semicrystalline regioregular poly(3- hexylthiophene) and selected semicrystalline commodity polymers, and show that, owing to a highly favourable, crystallization-induced phase segregation of the two components, during which the semiconductor is predominantly expelled to the surfaces of cast films, we can obtain vertically stratified structures in a one-step process. Incorporating these as active layers in polymer field-effect transistors, we find that the concentration of the semiconductor can be reduced to values as low as 3wt without any degradation in device performance. This is in stark contrast to blends containing an amorphous insulating polymer, for which significant reduction in electrical performance was reported. Crystalline-crystalline/semiconducting-insulating multicomponent systems offer expanded flexibility for realizing high-performance semiconducting architectures at drastically reduced materials cost with improved mechanical properties and environmental stability, without the need to design all performance requirements into the active semiconducting polymer itself. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

The geometric and electronic structure of the Magnus' green salt was investigated using density functional theory in the framework of a plane-wave/pseudopotential implementation. The DFT electronic band structure allows to identify the nature of the majority charge carrier and to predict the nature of the carrier mobility to interplatinum separation. A larger deviation of the cell length from the experimental value for the crystal is expected because the absence of interchain interactions in single-chain calculations should affect the relatively weaker interplatinum bonds to a greater extent.},

	abstract = {Titanium oxide hydrates are a class of materials that attracted strong scientific interest in the first half of the 19th century, but nowadays find use virtually only as precursors for the preparation of crystalline TiO 2. We re-visited these inorganic species and show here that they display highly useful properties. We demonstrate that dispersions of titanium oxide hydrates, prepared by low-temperature hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride, TiCl4, or titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) exhibit pronounced photochromism upon irradiation with UV light - especially when in the presence of glycerol. X-band electron-spin resonance spectroscopy reveals that the photochromism originates in the formation of TiIII species. The glycerol also considerably stabilises the dispersions, preventing aggregation of the titanium oxide hydrates and, thus, permitting preparation of transparent systems of high content of such inorganic polymers. When fully converting the Ti species to crystalline TiO2, the photochromic response is significantly reduced - if not entirely lost - indicating that titanium oxide hydrates were the true origin for the photochromism reported in the past for "crystalline TiO2". Clearly, the strong photochromic response can be taken advantage of, for instance, for the detection of amorphous fractions in crystalline TiO2 or the fabrication of UV light detectors. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

		"description" : "This research will concentrate on the development of processing schemes for the manufacture of organic optoelectronic devices, such as field-effect transistors, photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes and sensors. Particular attention is paid to the creation of model systems with well-defined interfaces and controlled molecular order; as well as technological relevant formulations that can be deposited over large areas. One focus will be on blends of organic semiconductors with bulk commodity insulators such as high-density polyethylene, polyethylene oxides, etc., that have shown to exhibit comparable optoelectronic features as neat systems even at a content of the insulator of 80 wt% and more. In addition, activities have been started to develop high-dielectric constant solar cell materials using a physical-chemistry approach in order to elucidate whether this can lead to organic photovoltaic systems that do not require bulk hetero-junction architectures. These activities will be underpinned by fundamental studies on the phase behavior and physical chemistry of organic semiconductors – neat or in multicomponent systems.",

		"description" : "This research theme concentrates on the design, fabrication, and application of photonic structures capable of precisely manipulating light for advanced optical and quantum technologies. We employ solution-processable, high-refractive-index, low-loss organic-inorganic based hybrid materials to photonic structures on rigid substrates, flexible supports, and optical fibers. These materials enable Bragg reflectors and surface-structured films while supporting the development of 2D and 3D photonic crystals through scalable solution and melt processes. By integrating these approaches with cleanroom-based nanofabrication (e-beam lithography, nanoimprint, and microfabrication), various designs of photonic structures that exhibit optical cavities, engineered photonic bandgap, and plasmonic enhancements are envisioned.",

Recurring themes include controlling polymer assembly from solution/melt or to elucidate the phase behavior of multicomponent systems, such as controlling the degree of intermixing in donor:acceptor polymer blends or semiconducting:insulating polymer blends. To this end, we employ a variety of structural characterization methods, including thermal analysis, X-ray scattering, microscopy, NMR, and Raman spectroscopy. Recent efforts have sought to expand these tools to understand the structural evolution in electrochemical environments relevant to biosensing or energy storage/conversion. We then correlate structure with the optoelectronic properties of the polymer, as determined from a variety of spectroscopic and electrochemical probes.",

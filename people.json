    "description": "Marlow studies the mechanical properties of hybrid inorganic:organic and mixed ion-electron conducting materials for bioelectronics applications. Outside of the lab, Marlow serves as the President of the Georgia Tech Student Polymer Network (SPN), a student organization that fosters interactions between graduates in polymer science, representatives at polymer industries, and the broader Atlanta community. Marlow received his B.S. in Chemical & Biological Engineering with a double major in Spanish from the University of Alabama. There, he researched ionic liquids and ionic polyimides for applications in carbon capture and additive manufacturing under Professor Jason Bara. In his spare time, Marlow enjoys home brewing, scuba diving, hiking through his home state of North Carolina, and watching both kinds of football.",
